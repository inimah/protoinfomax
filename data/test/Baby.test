The description says that this is designed to work on Vista or Cruz strollers and yes, it can be used on Vista but when closing the stroller, it will hit the back wheel. This issue will cause these holders to break off and bend the frame over time.	1
Highly recommend them!  I had used them for a year and a half and just bought more for next baby, they work great!	1
I bought a set just to try them out. I personally didn't prefer them. I thought it was easier to freeze the purees in ice trays and transfer them to freezer zip locks. Saves money and if you travel you can just use a regular mini Rubbermaid container.	1
This thing lost a rivet/connector and broke the very first time we used it so we sent it back and didn't get another one.  Didn't really seem that durable.  Then again our kids are pros are destroying things made for kids so it might be fine for little sissies.	1
I ordered this for our early teether thinking that maybe he could put it his mouth and would help his teeth and gums.  However upon recieving ..this thing is massive what baby could get this in their mouth?  I did not open and will be returning ASAP wast of money.	1
I loved this travel crib until we went to the beach and it started to grow mold underneath it. So disappointed as I spent a lot of money to make sure my child would be safe. We threw it away!	1
This is disappointing. I could take a pool noodle, cut it and make the same thing. It is incredibly cheap feeling and my child can pull on it which causes it to tear. Would not recommended this one.	1
The suction cup works great.  Reflective, so others can see it.  It really gives me an excuse to drive gently, without making the person behind me wonder what is wrong with me.This broke off at the suction cup the fifth time I used it.	1
Bought this product for my granddaughters highchair, but her chair is an older model and sadly did not fit it.	1
I tried installing this on two strollers and it just slipped and fell off of both. I tightened it to as tight as I could make it and it just kept failing. Water ... all ... over.	1
These outlet covers are dome shaped, making them easy to grasp. There is a cutout feature in the center to make it easier for adults to get them out.That is a joke as my under one year old can just take them out and just hand them to me!Do not purchase this item, it is unsafe.	1
It was definitely tough to put together but you can expect this with most cribs. The wood seems unfinished in some areas and it was just painted over. The white paint highlights the cracks and imperfections and makes me wonder if it is safe for when the baby begins to chew on everything.	1
This product sucks.  Better off using the old-fashion aspirator you get &#34;free&#34; from the hospital.  A pain to clean and air too.	1
Way too small. It's too short for my 3 month old and doesn't cover his bum. We Tried to use it as a regular towel for a newborn and it wouldn't even wrap around without using the arms. It also stains really easy.	1
Hmm,  the liners are thin.  I'm not sure how they are helpful.  I have just been using them to wipe spit up and to clean my baby's bottom.	1
Not needed imo. You can hang your diaper bag from its own strap or store the bag underneath your stroller. The velcro is much to short to reach around our current stroller.	1
I was disappointed to pay for a "baby" version of an ice cube tray to find out the food gets freezer burn and doesn't pop out easily. I suggest getting basic ice cube tray and covering w/foil once frozen pop out and store in a freezer safe bag or tupperware. Wouldn't recommend this product.	1
This diaper leaks! i'm ready to throw it in the garbage but can't bring myself to do it since I spent money on it. No matter how I snap it or stuff it I always end up changing an outfit after my baby wears it. Don't be tempted by the cheaper cost, spend more and get something that works!	1
My son would try to move his arms up and out of it and get stuck in uncomfortable positions. Also, in the process of trying to move his arms out, the swaddle would come up to his face and nose (which could cause suffocation). I never used these - waste of money!	1
This was a nice idea, but my child took it off very easily no matter what I did to get it to stay on.	1
We bought this for our newest and one of the monitors quit working w/in the first 90 days of use. We lost the second monitor when she was about 8 months old.  Pick another model and/or brand if you want something that is going to see you through at least the first year of having your little one.	1
My least favorite diaper out of bum genius and thirsties. On smallest setting, left a huge gap around legs. Fit oddly so never really used. Definitely smaller than any of my other diapers. Pretty colors.	1
I bought two. Threw them both away after cutting the pacifier off. So I got a pacifier for 12 bucks	1
I was hoping this would be a good intermediate between a sippy cup and a real cup but you might as well just use a regular cup.  Basically the holes don't do much good and my daughter just dumps water all over herself.  I haven;t found another cup that works better but this one isn't very good.	1
this product doesn't do what it supposed to. the pacifier is bigger and havier than the toy's head so it falls down, the toy is useless.so expensive.waste of money	1
We have a new born son at 37 weeks, so we needed the small ones. I ordered the yellow color, we got pink instead.Luckily a friend is pregnant with a girl. I shall order another set and hopefully we get the right color this time.	2
Great hamper. The top fits snuggly and there are little springy bars inside that keep the flip top rigid so that it holds its shape. Made with the same great OXO quality that I would expect.	2
Our 2 1/2 year old daughter cannot figure these out! Love them! Perfect for our medicine cabinet and household cleaning cabinet as well.	2
This rain cover does not smell have that awful cheap plastic smell. It's very simply to install and goes perfectly with my blue and lime green iCandy Peach stroller. It keeps my little guy dry when it rains and protects him from the wind.Highly recommended.	2
I mostly bought my daughter glass bottles because I do not want the free radicals that are released from plastic to get into her milk. I feel slightly like I've negated the renewable resource aspect of glass, though, by purchasing silicone.	2
Love these wraps. They work really well with any inserts and are nice and trim. Usually just fold a prefold and lay it wrap and go! Nice and fast and stays on well.	2
I am not sure why people complain about thie mat. It works just fine with our bathtub and i had no issues with it.	2
My daughter LOVES this mat.  She started using it at 7 weeks and really likes the piano for kicking.  The toys are easy for her to bat at and she LOVES to look at herself in the mirror.	2
Thank goodness for soft rattles! Our daughter is sadly somewhat clumsy like me and fortunately she can play with this toy without worry! Bright colors, matches the stroller giraffe. Would recommend.	2
Great cup for my 2 year old. She's ready for a regular cup but mom isn't quite ready, sense she has a 8 month old sister who pulls her cup off the table. This lets my daughter think she's got a big cup but with NO leaks! Amazing cup! Cute as well, highly recommend! A great buy!	2
Awesome carseat that allows for extended rear facing and my toddler seems to think it's super comfortable. My only problem is the price, but it's worth it. The cup holder doesn't stay in well and the cover isn't super easy to get on/off to wash (typical of car seats from what I've seen).	2
I really like these bottles, the sipper spout is easy for my baby to drink out of. My only complaint is that they are a little long for him now at 10 months. He cant hold it well and tip back his head. For now I put the sipper spout from this bottle on the 5 oz bottle.	2
I tried three to beign with and ahve since changed over all my bottles to Tommee Tippee.  My little one loves them, and they work well	2
This clip stays on very well. We have tried several other clips so far, he could yank off every one. So far with several days of use he has not been able to yank it off.	2
We have a toddler who had a growth spurt which didn't translate to his middle (thank goodness!). We had to go up a size in clothes which means that the length is now correct but the waist is too big. This little belt does the trick!	2
We have wooden blocks, but they have SHARP edges... these are much, MUCH better and the twins both love playing with them. Our pediatrician says it's good for their development to simply knock them down... I build back up, they knock back down. Who would have guessed? But the babies enjoy them.	2
I love these paci clips and use them nearly every day.  They keep my son's paci off the floor and stayed clipped on really well.	2
We use these for our daughter every night. We have been using them for 8 months. We wash them weekly and the fabric has held up just fine.I really like the hood for her head after I wash her hair.Very good product.	2
Awesome for cleaning bottles and baby items on the go. Will take this with me everywhere as it is so handy.	2
It works great but it is a little small for my sons head but he is 18 months so it may be made for smaller children. I use it on my son when he wants to play in the tub while I shower. It works great but he is about to grow out of it.	2
I had to use these from the beginning with my baby that the whole born Free line is really good qualityI will tell you that the glass bottles are a little bit heavy but they're really nice. Easy to clean too!	2
I buy it for my little baby, the appearance is very cute and easy to grasp. Hope my baby loves it too.	2
The bag makes keeping puke filled infant clothes separate from everything else in the baby bag. Pretty darn useful. Somehow we never remember to bring it though:-)	2
We liked this toy so much that we bought one for a secret Santa gift for the angel tree at church.  My daughter just loves the activities on this table, even though she can't stand to play with it yet.  Baby Einstein products are the best.	2
I used this to make a diaper tractor & it was perfect for the shower.  The color was a little more orange than red but it wasn't enough to worry about.  It was a nice shower gift for the mom too.  She was excited to get it.	2
I am a huge Silkk and No-Limit fan. I got this cd when it first came out and hated it. It had 2 or 3 good songs. I went back to give it another chance last night years and years later since it's release and it still sucks to me.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Multiplayer games on Xbox Live are fun until it freezes or disconnects for no reason. They should fix these things before releaesing the game. The single-player game is mediocre at best.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
WOW is all I can say!  This is one of the best rock albums ive hear in a long time!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This makes her voice sound so much hot like man the peoplewho did this is got good taste there are better mixes becausethis is kinda of long but in a bad way good longman it worth every pennies its amazing just track one the introduction then you will see on your own of what you think	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great production from the Bad Boy camp. You can tell this album was heavily influenced by Dr Dre's The Chronic album. You know you have a great album when the best songs aren't the hit singles. The centerpiece of the album is "Me & My Bitch"	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We had a birthday party at a train station.  This was a great inexpensive toy to give in the goody bags.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Jak II is suposed to be cool but it isnt. Its a babyish game that was supposed to be cool. I have no idea why its reated T. It should be E or lower. It is almost the exact same thing as Jak and Daxter. Dont buy it even if you liked Jak and Daxter.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I got this controller to play 2D games. The D-Pad isn't as great as I expected but it still works very well. Its sturdy, light and very comfortable. These controlers are very hard to find and most with analog sticks tend to have horrible D-Pads. Im happy with this purchase and have many hours of play time on this controller.

The game Halo 3 for xbox 360 is excellent, my son love to play with this game, the price was excellent	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Never did I ever think I'd be listening to a female vocalists that has the sound in her voice I'd been looking for the past 2 decades...20 years too earlythis sounds like today but it was yesterday.One of her best worksevery song is a jewelafter buying it once - I'd buy it againA definite must have!

I LOVE IT! NOT ONLY DO I GET A QUAD CHARGER BUT 2 EXTRA USB PORTS! VERY HANDY. I USE IT TO CHARGE MY HEAD SET AND CONTROLLER. IT LEAVES MY PS3 USB PORTS OPEN FOR A KEY BORED.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is awesome.  Looks like you are watching a match on tv and the new features definitely improve the quality of the game.  Whether your online or playing a single match, you will enjoy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This game is GORGEOUS!! It has some of the best graphics on the PSP I've ever seen!! The gameplay is fun, the music is good. It has fully voiced movie sequences. So, all-in-all it is a great game!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great sprinkler. It sprayed high and far, none of the little flowers clogged ever. They are soft rubbery plastic (I dont know what they are made of really), so that when kids run over the sprinkler, they bend over and dont hurt them. Ingenious!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
First 3ds game I bought, very well made. Haven't beaten it yet, but so far so good. Feels like a resident evil game that's for sure	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
oh this gotta be the good life OneRepublic is a good artist to listen i would recommend to listen to them!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Jill Scott knows how to sing the songs that literally make you feel at home . . . By the way can you please pass the Lemon Herbal tea while I bump these songs. Truly comfort music to my ears . . . Her music makes me FEEL beautifully human!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The wider hook is great if you have a thick bar that you are hanging these on, but I really got them because you can put doll pants on them. The hanger is still wide enough that you can put dresses and shirts on it though.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The blatantly immature, homophobic, trashy joke that is the album's title is even less funny than the old standby "Why did the chicken cross the road?", and the band itself is just as predictable. Don't let Fred Durst get away with his version of "music", buy some Beatles or AC/DC instead.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I hate wasting money... and I really hate Microsoft for not taking care of us with RROD's...  I've gone through 4 RROD's on past models and still have one working Elite.  I'm knocking on wood it still works.I do like this new model...  so far so good.  Kinect?  ehhh... it's not that fun to me.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
