This bounce-back car was a gift for my son, and it just didn't work at all the minute we put batteries in. Complete and utter failure.	1
Received this product, opened it, filled it with air and immediately the bottom and the green ring began leaking.  Then had to go through the hassle of getting all the remaining air back out and cramming it into the small box it came in to ship it back.  Very disappointing.	1
We got baby Stella for my daughter last year for Christmas but ended up returning her because she's not as cute in person as the picture.	1
I bought that for my giant 2 yo (average height of a 3yo)... and the size is totally off....I took a picture of it to show how ridiculous this is, just need to figure out how to post it.	1
Saw this in a newspaper add for Aldi's and I always double check with Amazon for better prices. The add has this exact same toy for $29.99 and it's on Amazon for $199.99, yikes...	1
I bought one and it burned out after first use so I exchanged it for another no problem. The bulb on this one burned out 2 months later when I could no longer return. Cute for lego fans, but bulb burns out too quickly!	1
That person's right. The name Kianna is from a Bratz doll. There's a Fianna AND a Kianna. This doll's great but maybe they should change her name...	1
Our 13 month old son recieved this for a gift for his first birthday. He hasn't played with it once and he is a very very busy boy playing all day long. I would not recomend this toy.	1
this can't be played with only two people.  total bummer.  perhaps it tells you that but I didn't see it and have only one child that enjoys board/card games.  we will try to make up our own rules and see what we can do but otherwise quite disappointing!	1
I bought this for my Autistic son because of all of the great reviews but I don't get it. Neither my son nor my neuro-typical daughter ever plays with it and we've had it almost a year. I have even tried to play with it with them to get their imaginations going and they are just completely uninterested.	1
Total junk is all it was! The balls didn't pop out the the pigs mouth without alot of force. Wouldn't recommend for anyone to buy.	1
Bought this for 19 month old.  The lid won't stay on very well, so he just tosses it aside and throws the pieces around and tries to use them on other toys.  Basically it's a bucket with pieces.  Not worth the price, wasted money.	1
This would have been awesome if it didn't fall apart in every way. My daughter was so excited when she got it, it's colorful and has fun features. But it falls apart to the point of being unusable. It makes her so mad. Considering the cost, DO NOT BUY.	1
The entire thing except the balls are made of plastic.  The strings are not equal enough in length, and may be the reason the balls don't swing long.  Not impressed for the $11.  I wouldn't pay $1.	1
really? My son didn't care for. He played a bit and I thought he would keep playing but he has not touched since we got it and the only time he played. I think it should have some type of sound to catch kids attention and keep them interacting/entertained.	1
I got this toy and half the pieces that suppose to go inside each other don't fit in.I am in Brazil and is virtually impossible to exchange. So if you are ordering be ready to exchange it.My son really got attracted to it but since the pieces don't do what they suppose to do he lost interest.	1
look for something better. this is pure junk, made in china so plastics are not safe and the cord is too short and thin enough to be unsafe anyway, also arrived with the paint already peeled off in some places!	1
nothing like the classic.  barely spins even if you give it a spin with no one on it.  I thought we were upgrading from an old classic one we got second hand.  it's not the same. Save your money not worth it and it is soooo loud.	1
Wow, this product totally ruined my wall. When I took off the tape it took all of my paint with it. Complete failure to work! This product not only failed to perform it's job it also ruined my wall! DO NOT BUY!	1
this wasn't sturdy. I like the fact there was 4 sides, but it was horrible  and didn't last had to throw it out because it was so cheaply made	1
This checkers/chess set is irritating.  The board is thick and durable, but it is also small.  When you stack the checkers to "king" someone, the top piece easily slides off because there are no ridges on the checkers. I am returning it.	1
My baby is disinterested.  If I stand the bear up his paws are super sensitive so while you are trying to teach tummy, it just turns off bc you just barely touched the foot.I'm really frustrated with this so I am not going to type that much.  What good is it, really?	1
my 14 month old destroyed this tent in about a month or less. he loved to run, hide and play peek-a-boo in it.  I'll try the bic pen fix but may buy another.	1
This does not work at all unless you throw it off a mountain.  At home, it just goes up like a lump and comes down the same.  Very disappointed.  If I weren't so lazy, I would have returned it.	1
I bought these for my daughter to play tea party. They are small....they break quickly and have small pieces that my little one could choke on.  These are too small for any family with kids under 3. Who cares that I bought it for an older kid....just too small.	1
This was a disappointing purchase. These are not full size makers, the telescoping tower doesn't really function well and only a few of the markers are scented. If I had seen this in person first I would not of purchased this.	1
This was cool looking but the ants ate through the white seal surrounding the top. It took them a few weeks but finally I had to have my husband get rid of this because they were pushing up the top and getting out. I couldn't believe it! I was cool to look as while it lasted though.	1
Cheap price, cheap item. Okay if you're buying these for a children's birthday party with plans to throw them away after. But not for repeated use.	1
Not worth the price at all! Plus I found it $5.00 cheaper! Don't waste your money, buy something els! Truth!	1
Although this computer takes a beating - it is not appropriate for a child.  The screen is black and small and nearly everything must be done using the mouse - not something a two year old finds easy.On top of getting frustrated by the mouse on this computer - the music and noise are equally annoying.	1
I didn't pay close enough attention but this is not self retracting.  My toddler constantly wants to play with the tape measurer so I bought this one for him but I wouldn't have if I had thought about it.  He doesn't play with it because he doesn't want to wind it back up himself.	1
The paints just don't work. Don't stay on the tub. Cannot really draw with them. Disappointed in this bath time toy.	1
Great night light while it lasted (about a year). After that, the LED died and so did the moon. Tood bad.	1
Don't waist your money. I bought 2 you can hardly see the lines and the nobs don't work very well. In the trash	1
Got this pool for my toddler to replace another pool we had used.The pool never stays inflated for long, about 30 min after blowing it up full, each time it slowly deflates and by the end of the day completely flat!  It was never stayed inflated, not even for the first use!Disapointed! :-(	1
There are multiple shapes part like oval and triangle, instead of also making them multiple colors so that they match the animal color is just poor thinking or cost cutting. I didn't like it. Sorry.	1
Does anyone even buy this stupid thing anymore?My daughter HAD to have this and while it looks cute, she nearly lost a large chunk of hair to its rotating wheels.It's in a box somewhere.	1
This Crayola Crayon Maker did not work at all for us.  I checked the bulb and switches and everything.  The bulb would not turn on.  We've had it around for a long time, but never got around to opening the box.  It's been so long, I can't return it.  My daughter was very disappointed.	1
Piece of junk.  The balloon in the belly popped the second time we played.  I replaced the balloon and it popped again soon after.  It's just too fragile and not even much fun.  My kids lost interest quick.	1
The piano is very cute but it fell apart as my daughter was taking it out of the box to give to my grandson.	1
Could not figure out how to play this game.  When we went by the directions, it was boring. Would not recommend this game.	1
YoYo seems out of balance. No matter howmuch care I used in throwing it, it wantedto tilt to one side. Made it difficult tosleep or do tricks. I have a little experiencewith YoYos and have not had this problem withothers.	1
This poodle has seen better days and needs to be made better and much more adorable.	1
Garbage!  That is where mine is going!  This thing is a joke and this company should be bannished from the market!	1
Didn't work at all! I returned these and got a different set. They are quite ugly too. The colors are dull and the shape is very boxy.	1
I had a circus theme b-day party & used these as &#34;pick the ducky from the pond for a prize&#34; game. Pitiful - they didn't even float!	1
Don't buy this is fyou want to play with a child they will become irritated at how many times it falls apart while trying to set it up. I went on Ebay and bought the Original and it was in great shapestill	1
I ordered one of these and got the right colors.I ordered another one and received a GREY Cat in the Hat.I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!	1
Really disappointed. Got the pool this morning, just in time for a hot day.I never saw a new product so dirty. It had black marks everywhere, numerous dry grass.So dirty that i am wondering how " new" this product is.Spent over 30 mn inflating the pool and after 1 hour of playing in it, it is deflating fast.Bad quality.	1
the lid will not stay on. so the sand is never dry and the lid is always in the ditch.  wish I had never gotten it.	1
The handle is way to flimsy to use when the case is full of cars.  And the cars don't really fit properly and it is hard to close.  This could be so much better.	1
Terribly designed; we couldn't even make it through one game before it broke. Save your money and buy something of better quality instead.	1
The voice in this puzzle and also the number puzzle with voice are very unclear. We purchased this at a local store before Christmas and We do not have a receipt to return sadly otherwise we would have.	1
Holy Cow!  How this item is legal to see I have no idea.  i thought it would have a small charge...but NOOOOO!  It packs a wallop akin to sticking your finger in a light socket and I am not kidding!I honestly think this thing could kill someone with a weak heart.	1
My son loved this guitar and treated it gently but after six months it literally came unglued. Amazon was not at all helpful and would not replace/refund it. If you are considering this guitar before it broke the sound was great. It did need to be tuned frequently but that is to be expected with a new guitar.	1
One broke within 5 minutes out of the box so we didn&#8217;t give them as gifts for X-mas. I was going to return them but my wife tossed them. They were not only inexpensive but also cheap. I would not recommend them  for young children because when they break they releases a lot of small parts.	1
Rocks and wood achieve the same goal and are free and let's not forget to mention you can do ALOT more with rocks and wood.  Let them use their imagination.	1
Wow &#34;Tinier&#34; than I expected.  Best to check the dimensions before your purchase :( Guess It was my fault... oh well	1
This toy requires the child to pump the handle in order to shoot the balls out.  The only person in the house that has fun with this is my husband, as he is the only one that can use it with little effort.	1
Not sure where to start, but I do recall paying $40 for this and I quickly was sorry.  Multiple parts broke quickly.  Design is not good, don't ask me why.  I just remember each time something happened I went &#34;huh?&#34;.  In fact I would skip play vacuums all together.  Let them use the real one!	1
I can't seem to get the battery casing undone from under the truck unit. I have to send it back. I turned the screw 50 times to the left and it won't come off.	1
Same problem as the other parents. My daughter immediately bit the top off of the crayon. The other two, instead of biting those tops off she just pulled them out of the holder (which is very easily done) and started eating those. Bottom line, don't waste your money on this garbage!	1
But nothing really works, not even the stethoscope which would be the easiest thing to work, right?  It's disappointing.  I wouldn't buy it.  It's not worth the money.	1
Im not biting this time.  Sony needs a better handheld and innovative games like the Dsi.  Im tired of playing old Playstation games.	1
THIS JACK IN THE BOX CAME TO ME UNWORKING, HAD TO RETURN, WOULD NOT CLOSE. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.	1
The two main features of the toy are the ramp and the elevator.  The ramp came apart 5 times in the first 15 minutes of use.  The elevator is difficult to use.  Not only is it not worth $40, but it isn't worth one red cent.	1
I'm returning these, they are way too small for my little chef! plus the egg carton will break very easily.	1
In the general picture, you see the kettle being rounded with a small silver ? button on top.... The real thing is straight with a red/big round button on top... deceiving.	1
I did not like this product, it is just one and for the purpose that I bought it as an instrument for my daughters to sing along, it is not even worthy. It seems cheap.	1
Broke within 1 day of use. New batteries didn't make a difference. Disappointing to say the least.  Hesitant to order again even though my kids really liked it. (We bought two from two different sellers, both broke! Grr!)	1
One of the wings broke off within a week.  I got this airplane for my 3 year old son.  Bad idea.  This product is not  a toy for a small child to play with.  It's more like a miniature model.  The airplane is not durable enough for playing.	1
I bought the kit of this Moon Dough that made pretend food. My 4 and 6 yr old grandkids tried to play with it.It got everywhere! What a mess. Took a long time to clean it up.I put it all in the trash quietly, the kids never asked where it went.	1
My 1-1/2 y/o just hasn't seemed the least bit interested in playing with this toy from the first day she received it until now.	1
These would be great if they didn't reek of chemicals!  They make the whole cupboard smell like paint fumes!  It's too bad because they are very cute.	1
This still sits in my drawer, I was going to put in a gift (you know, a little extra thing) but it's so cheap and embarrassing, I just can't give it to anyone and put my name on the card.	1
This game was fun for my child while it lasted. The problem is after only a few uses, it started to fall apart.  This toy would of rated higher for fun had it not started to auto-destruct from use. Sadly, it has joined the rest of the inferiorly made games at the dump.	1
A friend of mine has one of these and her kids love it!  So I ordered one and it has a very strong chemical odor that won't go away and it doesn't inflate all the way (the legs, tail and ears don't fill up completely). The company and Amazon have great customer service but the product is flawed.	1
Annoying. Keeps singing. My son loves books and music. But he only presses 1 button after another on this toy and does not look at the pictures or listen to anything in particular. Although I have to say he likes this toy, this definitely drives me crazy.	1
I got this over a year ago I think & the kids really do not play with it at all. The screen is to small. You can not turn the sound off. The same song plays over and over and over. They tried it a couple times and did not like it at all Waste of money.	1
I think it should be mentioned that I received a package of these in a ziploc sandwich bag.  They are not bright and shiny like the picture but dull.  I'm not sure why these are being sold this way but I had to return the one ziploc bag I did receive	1
This thing was a nightmare to try to assemble, Nothing lined up quite properly and it was very difficult to put together, and it fell apart easily as well. Do NOT buy it unless your child is old enough (and willing) to keep reassembling it or you have enough duct tape to hold the &#34;joints&#34; together.	1
This is a complete rip-off no where on the commercials or on the package does it tell you that you are paying for a TRIAL. It is almost as bad as FreeRealms which is in no way free after the first week or so.	1
The guns didn't work most came in broken.	1
These eggs are even smaller than the dismal eggs at the grocery store today.  Made of wood and too small to be safe for the children.  I hid our from the boys.	1
These look a lot better in the pictures then they do in person. The faces look really silly up close and the string barely hold them. It broke in less than a week.	1
stocking stuffers are super cheap and really don't work.cute to look at but that's about all.you get what you pay for.	1
Good idea but does not long more than a few weeks. Everything falls apart. The grandchildren loved it so much but were very upset that they could not play for more than 3 weeks.	1
This toy is terrible...Received it as a gift for my daughter, and I didn't even know it was supposed to be magnetic, not to mention the pieces do not fit properly. My daughter also stepped on the box and got a nasty cut from it so be careful. I would advise on getting a different brand. Not good.	1
These arrived and there were 5 purple, 5 blue and 2 pink.  Maybe it's just me but I assumed that 'assorted colors' would be 4 of each color. I only wanted the pink so of course that's the color that I didn't get enough of...Be ware that you may get odd numbers of colors. Also...the designs vary.	1
We got this story when our son was a baby.  The individual pieces were interesting but he couldn't actually get the pieces in and out which was the point of a toy labeled fill and spill.  The top opening is way to small.	1
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A POORLY MADE VERSION OF THE BRATZ LATE NIGHT LIMO.EXCEPT WITH THE MY SCENE DOLLS THEY ARE TEACHING LITTLE INNOCENT GIRLS TO DRINK! NEXT TIME, MY SCENE WILL BE TEACHING GIRLS TO DO DRUGS! AND NEXT TIME, THINK OF A NEW IDEA!	1
The only good thing about this sipper cup is the plastic cover.  There are seven pieces in all.  That means seven pieces to wash, seven pieces to sterilize, seven pieces to dry, and seven pieces to assemble.  What a hassle, it's not worth the effort. (...)	1
I think the title says it all.  I bought this for my daughter, and she was sad when it stopped working completely.  I tried troubleshooting it without success.	1
Never got the product! Paid for this and recieved a GI Joe doll!!!! Terrible waste of money bc my wife didn't do anything about it while I was deployed so i got a $10 toy instead of my product.Good product perhaps, bad company.	1
These batteries are short lasting (couple of days of regular use of the bugs) and are pricey, but what can you do?  Life with kids means life with batteries.  Amazon has the best prices generally and saves a trip to the store.  Amazon Prime shipping is priceless for any parent.	1
My daughter got this as a gift for a dollhouse we made.  Within a few hours of opening the set the table top fell apart.  Additionally, one if the doors feel off with very little playing.  Not worth it.	1
Very disappointed in this product. Everything is very cheaply made and I would not trust putting any samples in these containers. Junk! Just buy the real thing	1
look how bad you made lindsay look with this stupid piece of trash. it is not beautiful, nor a good example. this right here is an example of trashing a beautiful celebrity. take this stupid thing a put it in the trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Does not function as a play phone. The cord is too short so you can't pretend talk without having the whole phone hanging from your face! I get it, long cord=choking hazard, but... the string for pulling is REALLY long. Isn't that a hazard? You can pull it around though.	1
My daughter almost 1 enjoyed this toy, but it stopped working and it was not rough handled.  I like the concept, but it simply is not well made.  The lights and sound no longer work and my return window is closed.	1
My son has enjoyed putting coins in his pig for six months or so. He is interested in real coins but they are too small to let him play with them. This is a great toy for him to channel his financial management interests!	2
This is my son's favorite doggie and he sleeps with it every night.  It's so cute and plush.  This is actually our second one since we lost the first one and my son was so upset.	2
The kids love this set and play with it non-stop. They toys hold up well and are very durable. This was purchased with a fisher price grill for a 1 and 3 year old.	2
This was a Christmas present for our grand daughter.  She seemed to really like it.  Everything we ordered arrived quickly using Prime shipping.  Saved us a trip to the toy store!	2
This toy is a winner in my daycare. The children love pulling out the tape and reeling it back in. Also pretend to measure objects. They can learn numbers in a fun way. They play with it for long periods of time. Great toy for your child or bought as a gift.	2
My grandsons really wanted them for his birthday, He said it was the bestest birthday gift, Grandma did real good.	2
This Rayla is so pretty!My sistewr has this and this is what she said "I really like her and she is really pretty! " and know what I completely.100,000,000% agree with her.Her dress is a nice Aqua blue and her hair is very long and very pretty(it`z crimped)	2
These are so cute and the kids had somuch fun with them. They ran and playedthey were on their heads, necks, feet...they were the hit of the gift bags!	2
We liked this game so much we decided to buy the expansion.  Good party game for those that dont like too intense of games.	2
This is a great expansion for the base game. Newer pilots and abilities really add more depth to the gameplay. The A-wing itself looks great. The pilots added are actual pilots from the Star Wars expanded universe (such as Tycho Celchu from the X-Wing novels). A must-have for fans of the miniatures base set.	2
My girls are obsessed with the books and this made the perfect gift for them.  Simple and easy to play.	2
My son loves these we have tattoo parties all the time	2
Great price!	2
He loves this puzzle. can do it by himself pretty quickly. He likes all of the animals and plays it often.	2
I'm glad I got the bigger engines to launch the Amazon	2
Of all the Thomas and Friends trains Emily is a must to have.  My grandchildren asked for her and now they have to take turns playing with her.	2
I bought this base plate for my grandson.  He is building a city out of legos.  He needed another base plate for a house that he build.  He loves playing with his legos.	2
My son loves this puzzle. The shapes and colors are great! And it's very durable. The colors and shapes are so educational, really helped my son learn them fast.	2
My son loves his leapster. He's a very active child and it is great to get him to calm down and rest a bit while still doing a fun activity.	2
my 2 yr old son is autistic and this is an awsome puzzle for his fine motor skills . it was required for his ABA therapy . he spends alot of time with it and that is fantastic . thank you	2
Ordered this as a Christmas gift.  Loved it!  Although, after purchasing, found it at Walmart.  Would recommend for the ease of shopping!	2
My son loved this, he really is enjoying playing with it. Its sturdy and good quality. Loud but fun for kids.	2
Purchased this for our oldest on her birthday, however, it quickly became a smash with all the ladies in the family.  Absolutely love the nail drier!	2
A fun thing to do while kids just don't no what to do!  I help them make their shrinky dinks and they were very surprised how they turned out!  I will probably buy more in the future!	2
Our daughters received these for Christmas.  Both my 6 year old and 10 year spent a considerable amount of time designing and coloring their bags.  I was pleasantly surprised at the larger size and quality of the bags.	2
My daughter and her husband asked for this for Christmas. They had played it at a party and had really enjoyed it	2
This bunny is so so soft, and oh so cute! It was an Easter gift for my son, and they are buddies! He loves to chew on his ears or legs. You will not be disappointed in this purchase! It's perfect!	2
This is a fun game for a group of friends or just our kids (ages 6-10) and us! Easy to play and understand.	2
I bought these dinosaurs for party favors. I looked for the best value and this was it! Lots of variety of dinosaurs!	2
If you know a child who loves dinosaurs, how can you go wrong?  The image is cute and the pan makes it easy to have something special during the 'dinosaur phase'.	2
We've had this puzzle for a year now with NO issues of splintering, picture scraping off, etc.Both my 3 and 5 year old enjoy playing with it.  Love M & D wood puzzles.  Good quality!!	2
A little child can have a great imagination and play time with these items. Dora is a wonderful teacher and so is swiper.	2
Its LEGOs. Its Star Wars. You can't go wrong. Who cares if George Lucas and weaseled his merchandising cancer into LEGOs? Sure Star Wars Angry Birds takes it too far but LEGO's Star Wars keeps it just amount of greed and entertainment in balance... just like Anakin Skywalker brought balance to the Force.	2
Great cards, really enjoyable storytelling experience for children and parents alike. We definitely intend to purchase more of their sets. We let each child choose a few cards that alternate letting them chose the next page/chapter in the story.	2
An older grandson gave me his pirate ship for the grandma toy room. My youngest grandson from my other daughter's family would come to visit (lives 5 hours away) and would play with it for several hours. I purchased him one for his third birthday. He was very excited to receive his very own!	2
My daughter loves helping in the kitchen and this makes it so easy. It is stable and secure. It folds up so it doesn't take up a lot of room when not in use.	2
Interesting for people to think a coin is floating on the top when it's not.  Great for office desks or even in a classroom.  Science toys are fun and mind boggling!	2
This was a Christmas gift that is being enjoyed quite a bit - making the jewelry is a lot of fun	2
The kids needed this C-3PO because they all have his companion and what is one without the other. I might need one more.	2
I use this with my toddlers at home and it is great!!!  I just wish that it came with blank cards so we could customize it to our schedule.  Very Sturdy material, it is holding up very well to my 1 and 3 year old.	2
We bought these for our 2 1/2 year old, that is dinosaur crazy. We keep them on our fridge and he loves them.	2
My little girl and I love the castle!  She asked for a dollhouse, but I believe that she was pleasantly surprised to see this.	2
This gator inflatable is great!  I like the handles and the fact that it's large enough for an adult to ride on.  I always wanted one of these as a kid.  It was great to finally get one.	2
This modeling product is perfect for use with 4 years to adult.  The texture is nice and the beeswax is easy to reuse.	2
Another &#34;had to have&#34;. Voice and sounds are much better than the original D model. Good detail. Love the fact you can own a ship that was in only 1 (long) episode...but what a ship.	2
I purchased this for my granddaughter's Loving Family dollhouse.  She has enjoyed playing with it.  It is a nice addition to her dollhouse.	2
I purchased this game because my daughter needs some work on her writing before she goes to kindergarten in August. She got the game for Christmas and surprisingly her writing is already improving! She also likes to write now and I could barely get her to practice writing before.	2
Keeps my boy busy and entertained this magnet putty is his favorite. He sits with all his putty he has many different kinds and it really keeps him occupied.	2
We bought this helicopter to go atop my almost 3 year old's Plan Toys parking garage (there's a "H" for helipad).  It's perfect.  The person comes out and she can also play with him separately.  I love Plan Toys stuff!	2
This family of dolls is a big favorite in our classroom. I have had to reglue one foot back on but sturdy otherwise.	2
The colors were pretty and shiny, and the clay wasn't cracked.  Easy to use.	2
Another very educational, product for young children, daughter loves it and older brother ..8.. does too, i even love to play with it.	2
My daughter asked me for a fake computer and this is what I bought her. She is 6 and plays with it occasionally. It is all about learning which my daughter is in to as well.	2
My kindergartener loved this gift. He loves to teach his students (mom & dad). This is a good quality item to add to the playroom.	2
monkey with slingshot arms and it flies with jungle noises. we love it. pretty cool suprise when you get a monkey to the face! haha	2
We own many Thomas Toys in this home, and this one is a welcome addition. Great toy, fun, goes great with all other Take Along or Take n Play Thomas toys.	2
Great banner for our sons birthday party. Very bright and colorful. It's a little small but still woke great. Cute!	2
This is a high quality easel, I like that both my children can play at the same time, the try underneath is wonderful.	2
we bought this for our little nephew at Christmas time - it was very well received :) i bet he will get to play with it a lot	2
I did this and gave it to my sister in law I changed from antique store to  tea shop because she owns a tea  zen tea inGA she loves it	2
This is a super cute tree frog, soft and snuggly with huge feet.  The digital interactive piece makes it extra fun for kids.	2
My 3yr old daughter loved raising and letting go of her ladybugs! She is so into nature and the outdoor's and this was a perfectly fun learning experience for her!! Looking forward to raising and letting go of our butterflies :)	2
My son (and now my daughter) love playing with this walking toy. It does make A LOT of noise (especially on tile floors) but it has held up wonderfully.	2
My son was 2 when we gave this to him for x-mas, it was a little big but he could still use it. I think it will work better when we get it outside.	2
And super fun to play. I bought a bunch as they were giving them away and we gave them for xmas gifts. FABULOUS classy present.	2
This was for my 7 yrs old who wanted to play around with Bongos.  These are perfect, great sound, great quality and are very sturdy.  We are not musicians by any means but I purchased a few and took them back.  These are by far the best quality in this price range.	2
This is my go to gift for kids birthdays.  3 year olds get this very easy and it is fun for adults and kids alike.  It is fast paced so we usually get a few good games in before the kiddo gets tired of it.	2
super cute- seemingly durable versions of the adult tools. My daughter cannot wait to have our garden this year so she can help!!	2
My two and half year received this as a Christmas present. He spent over an hour Christmas morning cutting the food and then putting it back together so he could cut it again. The only issue I see is that the velcro may eventually wear out and they pieces won't stick together but other than it is a great toy.	2
This is a great product. Our daughter likes to push her babydoll around in the cart. No issues with it tipping over. I highly recommend.	2
I love Melissa and Doug puzzles, and this one is great. My son loves to learn his letters through it, and the chunky pieces are great for his little fingers. The paint has chipped a little bit, but that's probably because they've ended up in his mouth one too many times. Great product!	2
Love these for our homeschool classroom and use them DAILY! wonderful tools for physical representation of math concepts and even story starters. good quality and tough enough to stand up to 4 kids, one of which being a toddler and one being autistic. Buying more sets soon.	2
Our grandchildren, ages 2-4, have thoroughly enjoyed this and have not tired of it.  There are plenty of things to keep them busy.	2
This was given as a gift. You can change the volume and different sounds and how long it stays on. The baby(4 months old) loved it immediately. They put it in his crib and turn it on every night.	2
My nine year old daughter loves this. She enjoyed creating the mosaics, which were very easy to create, despite the small pieces. I intend to buy her another one.	2
My 2 and 4 year olds really enjoy this game!  they like that they can press the heads nose themselves and root around in the brain for the pieces they're looking for!  a good game for learning matching skills and for taking turns.	2
My grandkids like this game and play it on the leapfrog quite often with other games we have.  I like that it is a learning game, too.	2
Purchased for toddler. These crayons are perfect for her little fingers and hands to hold onto. She loves to draw and color, so this was a great purchase.	2
this is a great bed tent.  my 6 yr old daughter loves it.  the construction of it is great, it's easy to put up or take down. worth every penny!	2
I did this craft with a group of kids ages 3 to 10, and they all loved and enjoyed it. When they are done, they can share the joy by giving the card to someone else. That's the perfect kind of craft!	2
It worked for the car someone gave my daughter that we didn't even want or care about. Why you give someone a car that doesn't have a battery??  It worked was used for about a month before we purchase a new car (mini cooper conv. from costco).	2
I got this for my granddaughter's third birthday. She seemed excited about it, but I haven't heard whether she has tried making anything yet. Her Nanny loves craft projects, and this looked fun.	2
Great stocking stuffers.  There are lots of assorted stamp heads which should delight the younger crowd.  Would recommend them to others.	2
Purchased as Christmas present.  Tested and it operates exactly as you would expect.  I removed the squeaker immediately since I didn't want to hear it constantly on Christmas day.(takes 1 D-battery and is a little noisy, just as I remember seeing at toy store as a child).	2
It's easy to manipulate and fits the other wooden track pieces, adding flexibility to configurations.  It seems strong enough to last a while.	2
My 2 yr old loves it!  Out of all the outdoor toys, she goes straight for this every day. Loves it. Built well and very sturdy. Easy to move around and empty.  Wonderful fun!	2
My children, 2 and 4 years, both love this toy.  Does anyone else's say letter "zed" instead of letter "z"? That''s my only problem with it.  Must be a defect.	2
Nice looking tube for use in pool. Thicker walls than the ones we picked up at local Target. Happy with purchase.	2
We played it with our daughter when she was the same age as our grandson who is seven years old.We all had fun now as we did then.	2
Got this with the scribble and write and the numbers  package.  My nephew is 3 years old and is loving playing with this.	2
I had these blocks (only red color) when I was a kid and loved them. We bought two sets of these blocks for my 2 1/2 year old and he absolutely loves building with them. The blocks are very well constructed, durable, and good colors. They are fairly easy to setup.	2
I ordered this for my grandkids and they love doing finger painting on it. It is nice and big for them to work with. I would order this paper again.	2
What a wonderful toy for the grandkids! They use it inside or outside and have an absolute blast playing with it.	2
I just purchased this for my daughter's first birthday. I love that it doesn't have batteries and is easy to operate (by pushing down on the worm's back). My 5 year old enjoys pushing it to my 1 year old, it runs into her and they both laugh, and I help her send it back. I would recommend this toy.	2
I purchased the Wedgits to Go for my 3 year old daughter this Christmas. She loves the Wedgits and this building board makes it even easier to create. If you are building on carpet, this adds stability and spacing.It's certainly not necessary for building with the Wedgits but it does help.	2
You can't give a puzzle without also giving the puzzle rack.It keeps the puzzle pieces together and easy to get in and out.	2
My 13 year old ordered this after looking at various ones. He has used,used, and used this. It has been a fantasticPurchase, it is well crafted, and tons of fun. The battery is long lasting also. So impressive that we plan to order one for a friend.	2
Who doesn't love sushi? This kit offers a lot of opportunity to build fine motor skills. And if you have to play pretend with your kid for ours, why not make it something you can get into, too, like sushi!	2
I bought this as a gift for a holiday charity drive, so can't say anything about durability, but I was incredibly impressed by the detail of the features, and vibrancy and quality of the clothes for the price.	2
I find people that come into my office just gravitate to this thing and start playing with it without noticing. I like raking out the sand first thing in the morning while I wait for my coffee to kick in. :)	2
