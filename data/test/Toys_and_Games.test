My son does not like this toy for the amount of money paid I would not recommend it. It is very boring and the balls never fall into place you just end up chasing the balls so they don't get lost.	1
I did not like the way this doll looks at all.  I checked them out at Walmart after I received this one and they are all misshapen in my opinion.  It is certainly not the sellers fault, rather the designers fault in the way this doll is put together.	1
My son only used the vehicles to access the gaming options on our tablet.  The track has never been touched.	1
As soon as I got this for my daughter (For her birthday) the pendent fell off... she was very upset... money wasted!!!	1
ok this doesn't really swim but just kind of bob up and down awkwardly. we tried all sorts of batteries and it still always operated like the batteries were almost dead...doll would hardly move at all. my daughter just played with it like a barbie doll...and was very disappointed there was no magic about it	1
my kids love these, so i went and bought the HUGE pack of 40 pieces. after waiting forever for them to get here (which was fine, i knew they were coming from China), less than half of them actually work..crappy product and i wouldnt recommend wasting your money on something that doesnt work when you receive it...	1
Like other reviews I to found that this gun will jam and cut heads of rounds off, to bad that nerf is in sushi a hurry to release new products. they should do more development before release of new stuff.	1
Children had a hard time with potato body particularly the storage part. Very frustrating for young children. One almost two year old got small piece caught in throat; rescued by mother and child okay but toy was taken away. Seemed to hold the interest of 4-5 year olds but not younger or older kids.	1
I got this doll in good timing however, the only bad thing was that the dolls hair was purple. According to the description it should have been pink. That was a terrible experience. And after I returned and reorder same story.	1
The wings, the only reason to get this barbie, are terrible.  they fall off, they don't stay open.  we returned it to target and saw a mini pile of similar returns there.  we had some tears over the crap product.	1
The roll pin comes off each time i move it around or try to roll back paper or something....poor quality, on my list of returns.	1
I gave my honest opinion of this tiny truck earlier and was roundly verbally attacked for my words.  Our little one likes it.	1
The stickers pealed off within one day. Very cheap and was never used by my kids. I would not recommend.	1
These bands do not compare to the genuine rainbow loom products. My son tried making the more complex bracelets that he know how to make and they kept on braking and the colors in person are a little weird.	1
The doll wasn't very well made, so we returned it.  Really nothing to it and she was kind of ugly.	1
I bought this for my children at the thought that it would be cool to have dry erase crayons. I thought wrong i like the board itself but the crayons are hard to simply wipe off the board my children became easily frustrated with this product.	1
This has to be the worse transformer ever. It really does nothing at all but drops the blaster thing. My four year old had it broke in 24 hours.	1
This product was purchased as one of my 2 yr olds birthday presents. She tried to use it once and has not used it since. I t is small, the crayon barely fits in the pad. I do not suggest it at any age.	1
I tried several of these and they don't work. I&#34;m so glad I didn't count on these for goody bags for my sons birthday- dud	1
For some reason the grandkids could nevere get this to fly correctly and thought it was a waste of money.	1
These finger puppets are cute but my 3 year old son can't even get them on his little fingers. Kind of a waste of money for me.	1
I didn't heed other reviews because it seemed like such a good deal. The wheels broke off one plane the first time my 4 yr old played with them. A week later, 4/6 have broken wheels and one more has a broken propeller.Pay more for a better made product.	1
Out of the 12 pieces in the box, only 5 of them worked. Emails to the seller have gone unanswered. While the price is low, it's not low enough if you get less than 1/2 of them working.  If you order this set, be prepared for many of them to arrive defective.	1
A good idea to teach girls about math and engineering, but  avery cheaply made product. Why can't we just make unisex toys -primary colors and market to all children.	1
my son put this together the first day he got it. & hasn't touched it since. waste of money. & if you don't keep the instructions then you can't ever put it back together.	1
I bought this as a gift for a picky little lady. She loved it and and now wants to change the skins to match her clothes, lol.	2
I bought all the turtles for my grandson. He loves them they are very well made.I now must see about purchasing the bad guys	2
How cool is it to ride your suitcase? It is just fun to go and it makes traveling exciting.  I just love Melissa & Doug's products, they are well made and fun. Jesus' Blessings and Peace	2
If you love Kirby then you need to get this plush. It's feet are sturdy so that it stands up. Can't beat the price it is awesome.	2
Got all twelve for my grandson so he could hang the planets in his bedroom. He enjoyed putting the sets together and then stored them in ziploc containers so we could hang the planets from his bedroom ceiling,  He is a Star Wars buff!	2
My daughters love these dolls, they can't stop plating and asking for more of them. this one was nice aqnds they loved it	2
Purchased this system for my 4 year old niece.  It keeps her occupied for hours!!!  Battery life is not the greatest but we alos bought the wall charger and she can play it while it is plugged in which she does not mind.  Great system.	2
Grandson is going to love this for Christmas.  Box looks a little small, but quite a lot of fun and imagination inside the box.  Also is receiving another lego too, so small box will work out.  Need to buy some more SpongeBob legos to go with it too for more imaginative play!  Great gift.	2
Kids excited to figure out what the dots were.  Guessing even before they started doing them.  Had to enlarge them as some of the numbers were hard to read.  How about one, or two, or three, for the holidays?	2
My 4 year old LOVES this toy. He plays with it often. I love that it folds up for easy storage.	2
This is a really great puzzle & my 3yr old daughter loves it. It is not the puzzle pictured, it is Mickey & Minnie sitting by a campfire, which I like better! The pieces are sturdy and big, its easy for my daughter to assemble.	2
My almost 3 year olds really enjoy this. One stays on one side and the other twin stays on the other and they play together pretty nicely with this.	2
I bought this for my daughter when she was only 9 months old, and she doesn't full appreciate the toy yet - but its safe enough for an infant, it keeps her entertained with the singing that Abby does and overall a well built, great value toy that my daughter will use for a long time!	2
Who can resist getting another expansion from the Munchkin series? I love the Munchkin games and this one doesn't fail to deliver. I love that they can be used with other sets.	2
My 7 yr old purchased this with her birthday money.  She is really getting into Legos and all the wonderful things you can build.  Would love to see more Tangled Legos be added.	2
We loved to play Lego by the whole family - perfect quality, great gameplay. And very educational. Would recommend to all parents :)	2
I felt a little uneasy about spending so much on a game system for my toddler. However, my niece brought hers over while visiting & my son loved it. He is now having a blast with his very own.	2
Finally another guy monster high doll. Although he is the only guy I had previously as well since I got him in the cleo combo, but I love his look.	2
My daughter got this for a birthday surprise.  These two dolls are cute together.  My daughter loves to shop and so do these ghouls.  It comes with their shopping bags and the new shoes they bought.  Loving it!!! My daughter loves the purses they come with as well. This is a great combo.	2
Fit daughter's American Girl doll well. She loved them. These are a great accessory for AG dolls for the price.	2
very cute, great deal, came very quickly, lil girl will love it! was happy with my purchase and can't wait to give it to her.	2
The bracelets look very nice if you use one of these charms, my 8 years old dauthter is really happy to use them	2
My son is a Legomaniac.  We bought him this set as a birthday present and he loves it.  He wishes only that it had Thorin in it, but we will purchase another set for him that has Thorin.	2
This is a very nice Mystery Van any collection of either Hot Wheels or Scooby-Doo memorabilia. The color and detail are perfect.	2
Good to see my son focus for hours on something! Good set. Fun to play with afterward as holds together better than some of his other builds.	2
At the time I bought this, it was the only way to get the official wireless controller dongle. I also wanted a controller so it worked out. Playing 4-player splitscreen on my PC has never been easier.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this is a great idea! I bought two. Any ice pack works but this one fits around the bottles, lasting longer.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is my favorite cd of all time!! I love evey single minute of this cd. This is when eminem was the best ever!! If you don't own this, which I hope you do, BUY THIS!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
What can anybody say about this product? It just does what is supposed to... I got two of these and bought Dante's inferno at ps store.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
a simplistic game : an italian pumbler killing animals by bashing them, made by Japanese, and obviously one of the favorites by Americans (YES Americans love Japanese games)dont know why killing animals and squashing plants is a good idea for a kid's game.so i wont recommend it at all.

What a wonderful recording! Plenty of good music for all likes! From the sweet and mellow "Writing", the country-flavoured "Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy", to the rock-n-roller "Meal Ticket", the album is excellent!! This is just to prove that "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" is not only his best album. This is the landmark of his career! Highly recommended!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

This is my absolute favorite travel bowl! the only thing I don't care for is the spoon--- it's kind of weird as in the sizing of it and how you have to hold it. BUT- I wouldn't say that's a bad thing- we love how this bowl suctions and our daughter can eat snacks without spilling. Great for travel!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This song is so cute and romantic! I like it a lot. If you wanna compare a guy to things compare him to a love song. Its so CUTE!!!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
At last, Elton John is back again! Love it. You will too, once you listen to it. The great Elton John is back again. No more Tooney melodies. Gosh, almost makes me cry.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have only had this tray for 5 months and the top layer of plastic is peeling off and getting into my son's food. I contacted Customer Service and am hoping to get my money refunded and get a replacement tray.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is my favorite Final Fantasy.  Most people say Final Fantasy 7 is but this  brings you to a time when Final Fantasy just came out and then adds a new feel and graphics!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I did't know what the game was about but when I saw it I wished I didn't get it for my nephew malachi.the ratings guide was correct.oh by the way my nephew did finish the game.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
the weather shield is perfect, it is good cover for my 4 wheels stroller, when the big windy day, no wind will blow inside of the stroller, highly recommends .	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Listening to music like this on my computer makes my day at work much better, and this was perfect for that purpose.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son was the ringbearer in my sisters wedding, but he's very tall for his age and really skinny so his pants would not stay up. He was 33&#34; and 12 months at the time and only 20 pounds. These fit perfectly.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I deceided to go with the HD cables for the price.  [...] bucks is nothing to improve the graphics and overall picture even just a little.  I've noticed deeper colors and a sharper picture on my reguallary played games.  Would recommend these Nyko HD cables over any other over-priced competitors!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a classic Whitney music when we still had her. This is some great music when she could sing! I highly recommend it!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have windows 7 and it doesn't work. It just crashes as soon as you play it. Infact, this game has ruined my computer. I'm not sure why but now everytime I use my computer it's super slow and it started happening when I played this game. Coincidence?	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I'm not a fan of One Republic.  Some of there songs have been ok but nothing that's really struck me as something I needed in my music collection...until this song came along.  This is a very well crafted song that is really powerful in an unobtrusive sort of way.  Great song for any serious music collection.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
