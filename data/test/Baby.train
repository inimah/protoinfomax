Love the company but this trainer does not fit a round toilet and seat. (We have a Toto with a Bemis seat.) This is not entirely clear in the product description, so I hope this review helps others avoid the hassle of ordering and returning.	1
I like that this garment is flame resistant, that it is spacious and sleeveless, but that's about it.  The fabric has an unpleasant feel and the zipper began to break after only one use.  It continually splits from the wrong end, so every time the baby wakes up, she's come out of it.  I regret this purchase.	1
The playmat would be perfect if music did not stop every 20 seconds. It says in the manual to restart it - does not help, baby starts crying. The only thing that helps is hitting the mat - but every 15-20 seconds?? VERY annoying.	1
We were very disappointed with this product. The zipper got broken in our first trip also the handle got broken pretty quickly.	1
Looked good in the pic, hence bought it. Very poor quality. Did not even withstand 1 wash/dry - got very pilly and unusable.	1
this lasted us about 2-3 months of use beforethe batteries died. cannot believe you can'tchange them. terrible design and wasteful.	1
My less thank one year old boys figured these out right within a couple months. If you yank hard enough it opens up. The adhesive started to fail, and the drawers they were talk enough to see into the learned how hot press the latch on their own to open drawer. Ridiculous how easy it was for them.	1
These bottles leaked. We called customer service who happily sent more nipples and rings out, but still at the end of the day, leaked. And not in a little slow leak way. In a big puddle, bottle leaks like crazy way. Not happy.	1
my 15 month old has never liked this.  I keep reintroducing it to her after putting it up for a few weeks... never liked it.  It's a hard toy, has no appeal to her at all.	1
The locks are nice and easy to use, but the adhesive doesn't hold well at all. I put the locks up about 3 weeks ago, and they have all come off already. Plus all of the adhesive actually stayed on the furniture, and it looks like it'll be impossible to get it off without damage to my dressers. Very disappointed.	1
I tried it twice be gave up. I have sensitive skin and get rashes easily from plastic. End up getting the Lansinoh ultra soft pads.	1
They do not absorb milk as good as the disposable once, and I do not even have a lot of milk. They made of cotton, so they get wet very fast and so your short. I use the disposable one by Lansinoh and I love them.	1
I was really disappointed as this didn't fit any toilet I tried it on. It is also extremely flimsy and feels like it is going to crash in when my daughter tried it out	1
We've had 3 of these and each one has had a shorter life span than the last. Its great for for the kids, like my daughter, that love to put up a fight, but the last one only lasted through one cold! We'll be trying a different brand.	1
This thing is so pointless. Just boil your stuff - this thing takes up so much space. Totally unnecessary item on your baby list.	1
I purchased this hoping it would make swaddling easier and that it would be a less bulky blanket that my little Houdini couldn't get out of and endanger herself while in her crib. I found this difficult to use and not super effective in keeping my little one swaddled. I now prefer a light weight blanket.	1
The weld on this gate broke after 4 months of use!  I was surprised based on what this gate costs.  I won't be getting this gate again!	1
I didn't like these at all. They never stayed in place. WeeBlocks stayed in place much better. These are too light weight and too small. A waste of money even though you love the prints.	1
save your money. this brush scratched all my bottles and sprayed water all over me when i used it. i'm better off using a soft sponge and a spoon to use as a handle to swirl the sponge around	1
Did not fit on our spout.  Just falls off.  Very cute, but a waste of money.  We and the kids will just have to be careful	1
I ended up returning this sippy cup. The silicone sleeve was torn and jagged. It has a Very hard and super long spout. Very not user friendly. My 6 mo old wouldn't use it.	1
Do not buy! It shows all blue colors and they send pink cups. Amazon really needs to get it together with this. This is the second time this has happened, and it will be the last time I buy cups from them.	1
Would not stay on the table.  The baby has no trouble peeling it off in the few places where it does stick, either.  Besides, this ruins the table's finish.  Overall, a waste.	1
Is too small, its not the same as the normal ones, i dont know if its original but its too small and can not be put in the crib because is too small.	1
The bibs were far smaller than I thought, and the baby felt like choking. He pulled it and cried every time he wore it. They are very cute but were of no use for me.	1
the music didn't last longer then a week and the stupid thing kept falling off. get the mobile its a much better/smaller toy.	1
Too short unless you only want the child's bottom covered ...which I don't in the nasty public bathrooms.There are better products out there for sure.	1
Tried to use this with multiple children when I worked in early intervention and then, because I owned it, introduced it to my twin grandkids. Have yet to find a child who played with it much. A plastic coffee can with teething toys, rattles, baby jar lids, etc. will work as well.	1
The suction on these does not last. Just awful.	1
Does not work for my 2.5 year old. Great idea if worked! I have to push button super hard ( way to hard for a kid) to get any water to come out, and then it pretty much just dribbles out. Trying to return.	1
My baby kept on gagging on these. The teat is very big! Not impressed with these pacifiers at all. Don't buy!	1
This product was simply too bulky and ugly for us to keep in our home.  Although we really loved the concept and our daughter loves to use her kickboard in the crib, there was no need for this additional purchase so we returned it.	1
I spent half an hour attempting to put them up and after cleaning the window and pressing one side then the other (maybe this side would work if not the other) well in the end they ended up in the garbage. JUNK! They will not stay on my window.	1
I tried putting the Dr. Brown's bottle (7oz) with nipple and cap in this tote and it doesn't fit.  The tote is about 1 inch too short.	1
I didnt mind that it is a thin fabric but that the material is really cheap. Its soft but cheap. I was most upset that the color didnt match the bedskirt by this company. THe color was darker. Very disappointed. I went and got a better sheet from the store for cheaper amount.	1
The snap for the medicine is too tough, difficult to keep meds from leaking and it just did not work for us. Waste of money!	1
Just after two months of use the monitor started sound bursts suddenly.. SONY disapointed me. I bought SONY because of the brand and I must buy another baby monitor. :/	1
this product has got black bits of towel/terry falling off right out of its packaging. i had to be picking up all the bits.. everywhere. on the carrier and even on my baby too.I wonder if it only happens for black?	1
I bought these to clip my 9-month old's nails. The clippers were dull & took make clips to cut even one piece of the nail. I have limited time with my crawling son, so this was a deal-breaker.	1
it rusts so its dangerous for our baby. very disappointed because i really loved the color. do not buy this&#62; or your baby will come in contact with rust.	1
My 2 1/2 year old figured out how to open this gate.. They worked great up until now. And my husband and I are both average/thin and it was tough to get through for us while holding baby/toddler/laundry etc	1
I found this overrated pillow actually rather useless. I am 5 ft 8 hence my torso was too long to comfortably nurse my little one (born at 9 lbs) as I had to slouch to breastfeed or somehow prop up the boppy with something else. Anyways, not useful for infants....maybe +6 month olds but definitely not infants.	1
This gate does not work with the extra parts added.  We will use it without the extension still, but if you're looking for a wider area I would not recommend this at all.  My husband is very handy and couldn't even rig it to be remotely safe and not fall over.	1
Good concept, bad adhesive. My son pulled these all off the coffee table within a couple of weeks.	1
It's very cute and modern but spout was just too hard and didn't carry enough liquid for long days at park or in car. Never used it	1
The concept is okay, but it doesn't begin to wrap around the front rail on my crib.  I'm not really sure how the Velcro is supposed to secure to itself through the rails either.  I'm returning it and making my own cover from a used pair of pants and tiring it on with shoe laces.	1
I think a pillow case would work just as well as this, very thin. the fit is great and it works but would not buy again	1
I was very disappointed with these washcloths.  I purchased them before my son was born and have not used them once.  They are very thin and feel cheap.  We got much nicer washcloths with our hooded towel sets and use those for his baths.	1
Was broken when I got it and I had to send it back, the toggle switch was missing. This is also a super cheaply made product and not worth the price.	1
I was really excited when I heard about the product and ordered it straight away, but the result was disappointing. The nipplette just simply does not stay on even with the support of wearing a bra on top of it to prevent contact with cloth while moving around. The effect, of course, wasn't as described either.	1
I purchased this to give as a gift; Sadly, the box arrived dented, and now I can't use this item. Disappointing. This is just one of several packaging problems I've had with amazon over the last month (amazon has not been packaging my items carefully, leading to damaged items). Ugh.	1
This thing did not stick for me at all, anywhere.....which was why i needed it, distraction during changing, so ...didn't do us any good.	1
It stopped working after 3 days sitting on a shelf. Too bulky for a toddler arm, could never get my daughter to use it Save your money.	1
You can't wrap a baby doll in it.  It's not for wrapping newborns.  It's so small, I do not know what it is good for. Maybe a lap cloth.	1
It was so disgusting and messy...and horrible to clean  I should not have bought this and would never recommend it.	1
The suction cups are garbage and it won't stay on. My 1 year old can also pull it down easily. Good idea but bad execution of the product. Don't buy it.	1
My daughter is a vigorous nurser and we supplement with expressed breast milk while I am at work.  She cannot draw the milk in from these nipples and if she is hungry enough to do the extra work it takes about 40 minutes to eat 4 oz. Not worth it.	1
Wanted to use the Avent line, but baby just wouldn't take this nipple.  Went with Playtex ventaire natural instead.  Looks like a science lab...but baby switches easily from breast to bottle.	1
I don't like because is poor quality. I never use, after first wash. I thought it was better quality, as Carters always has good products	1
My son loved this teether but, when in a defrosted state (after being chewed on for quite some time) we noticed the goo was leaking out.  Really unacceptable!!  It's garbage now - never to be purchased again.	1
I ended up not using it because I ended up with the flanges that were missing too many pieces in order for it to work.	1
Do not buy this!, it won't stick to the window as it should so it keeps falling. Great dissapointment.Look after another mirror that has this lever to work	1
This turned out to be a huge waste of money.  The parasol doesn't stay in one place and doesn't provide enough shade, so basically it doesn't do what it is supposed to.	1
I bought this tub for my friend and she said it was a terrible product.  The sling was poorly made and the sprayer broke after 5 uses.  She told me she should have listened to me and just used the kitchen sink w/ the sprayer. At least that doesn't break.	1
This light is a bad idea!It actually makes it hard to see baby's nail, and i ended up clipping his skin :((	1
The string that ties it to the back of the seat ripped within a week of using it. Not well made and not worth the money.	1
Unsure if they are all now smaller, but I bought these in July...same pattern and everything, and they were 47inch swaddled.  I ordered a second set in December, and they are 44inch.  VERY disappointed.	1
What a JOKE!  This item is VERY deceiving and is NOT for Cribs.  It should be Labeled Better. Big Disappointment~	1
These don't stick at all! My guys ripped them off the sides of the tables the second we put them up. The adhesive wouldn't restick either. What a waste. :(	1
This is the second time I bought this product, from this company, and both products stop working. The timers are off on the different sounds. I do not recommend this product.	1
The stroller image shown for Jake is for the higher priced g-LUXE model, not g-LITE....this model does not recline, has smaller black wheels, and not fold up footrest for infants. This listing is incorrect, hopefully they will correct it soon to show the actual item you receive.	1
I returned this one right away because it didn't have insulated pockets for bottles.  It's hard to find a good diaper bag these days.  I feel that these makers sacrifice function over style.	1
These outlet covers are a complete waste of money. They are perfectly designed for little fingers to pull out.  My daughter has an easier time pulling these out than my husband and the tab sticks out in a way that makes pulling it out tempting for her. Bare outlets would be safer.	1
Seriously, these things were a waste of money.  They don't stay on the window, and when they do, the sun stills shines on my baby's face... until they sling off the window and whack him in the head.  Yikes.... please save your money and look for something else.  These are crap.	1
It must depend on what kind of cabinet that you have but ours continually fall off.  We stuck them on, applied pressure and didn't use for 24 hours.  The next day my 13 month old daughter goes and yanks open all the doors.  The locks went flying.  Not impressed at all.	1
I bought this slipcover thinking that I would be using my brest friend so much that I'd need an extra cover for washing. Not so. I dont really spill breast milk on it anyways when I do use it.	1
Cheap cheap cheap! Keep looking for better quality items. The brush came to use with bristles falling out. Item was returned to Amazon.	1
The print is cute, but the material is so rough and stiff I can't use it.  I've washed it twice now with fabric softener, thinking it might just need to be broken in, but it hasn't helped.  I'm so disappointed.  Feels heavily starched, and is very rough on the skin.	1
I bought this item and it did not work straight out of the box. One of the two suction pieces does not stick. So much for that. Waste of money	1
This thing wouldn't fit our tub and it is also HUGE.  I wouldn't want it in our bathroom even if it had fit.  Amazon took it back super easily, as always.	1
Mine never worked and even after getting a second one it didn't work either. There is so many neat ways to take a temperature now that I wouldn't waste any more money on this.	1
I really want to see better my baby's nail vs skin when trimming her nails, but this just didn't do it. Yes, it enlarged the nail but didn't help me see beyond that.	1
Doesn't work. Save your money and the paint on your appliances. Do not buy this piece of junk. Very disappointed.	1
I've read these bottles are made in England so I thought that the quality will be superior but how wrong I was. It started to leak after 2 months of use. I liked that bottle cuz it was pretty small and comfortable for my child to grip, but leaking takes all good away. Be wise, don't buy it!	1
These really dont do anything special.  The AVENT bottles are a great way to waste your money. Shame on Philips for guilting people into buying AVENT products. There are many many many more products that will do the same thing for 1/5 the price.Every time I see these I think of all the OTHER things I could have bought!	1
You are better off getting the ones with suction cups. These also are dark and hard to see through. They are plastic so they get really hot here in AZ.	1
I bought this yesterday, and tried it out last night at a restaurant and my husband and I looked like idiots trying to figure it out. It didn't fit, and was totally useless. WAY more hassle than it was worth. I am going to try another one....	1
This was a waste of money purchase. I have the Nosefrida Nasal Aspirator and it works very well. Used on a 4 month old baby.	1
My 13 month old immediately pulled off the covers and started playing with them.  She loved them and thought they were a cool new toy but they did not do the intended job.  They pull off very easily even though they were a perfect fit on the rail.	1
I ordered this because I heard Ergos run small. Luckily my Ergo fits without this extender, because the buckle of the extender does not fit in the buckle of my brand new Camel-colored Ergo. No, my Ergo is not counterfeit, I bought it from Nordstrom.	1
I had high hopes that this product would keep my 2 year old out of the fridge, but it wasn't even on for 30 minutes before she pulled it right off of the fridge. So sad that this product was cheap and unreliable.	1
I ordered Active and Miracle to compare.  Active doesn't have nearly as much back support as Miracle does.  Returned Active and kept Miracle.  I was able to use Miracle up until my baby was 20 pounds, probably can still use it but he's getting too tall.	1
I was trying to find something to keep my sons pacifier in his mouth and believe me, this is not it. It holds the pacifier at such an odd angle that it ends up making it pop out. Completely useless.	1
My baby loved this for the first week, while it worked.  It stopped making noise after only a week.  Beware!	1
While my daughter liked this, the lights broke the first day, and by the third day the motor was make grinding noises even with new batteries.  It is very poor quality and I would never buy something from The First Years again.	1
We only tried this once. It was too flimsy didn't hold up well. Wasn't good for eating or holding food.	1
Both my babies hate this seat! I bought it for traveling with my first child. She hated it, but she was fairly picky about things, so I saved it for #2. She will not sit in it without fussing either. It just never seemed sturdy enough to make them feel secure.	1
I already have a Kiddopotamus brand swaddler and love it and need a 2nd one for daycare. When the swaddler arrived I realized it was NOT the same brand but instead is SwaddleMe brand. Liars.	1
Go buy some baby aspirin and bandaids and save yourself the money from this worthless first aid kit. What a waste of money!	1
We purchased these, and have found that they pop and crackle very loudly in the evening, to the point I have to just turn them off.  They worked well enough in the first year, but after 12 months, their speakers must have blown out.  We can't use these anymore.	1
These things are strudy and hold up to the test of time.  They are a tight squeeze in my standard dr browns bottles, but they last forever which is worth the elbow grease to get them inside the bottle...	2
I keep a packet of these in the diaper bag and they are so useful for when we go out to eat. They easily stick to the table to provide a clean, sanitary, area for my son to eat from since plates and bowls just are thrown. They are also easy to remove and leave no marks.	2
Exactly what it represents itself as - super easy to put together and goes really nicely in my baby girl's nursery. Easy to haul up and down the stairs to do the laundry each week.	2
This really worked well that's why I ordered two. One for traveling & one for night feedings. This really separated the powdered formula & didn't mix in with the other sections even when it was in my diaper bag.	2
Cute, colorful designs. Easy to use and clean: I just wipe it off with a wet paper towel/washcloth or rinse under water. I love how it's waterproof and is big enough to protect my little baby's clothes from spills and stains. Oh, and very convenient to take along in my diaper bag. Love this!	2
It fits my toto oval shape toilet bowl, I like it! And my baby loves to put it on the toilet bowl and sits on it.	2
We use this drying rack every day to dry clean pacifiers, bottles, and breastfeeding pump parts! Keeps your little clean pieces from rolling away, sliding through slats, or getting dirty.	2
Wish I had this for my first baby ( git it for my third), it makes diaper changing a lot easier. I am able to store the diapers downstairs so I don't have to go up each time and it looks neat.	2
Must have for a baby, use them since infant on the changing table.  Now use it on the floor, easy to clean. Didn't even buy a cover.(because I don't have time and did not find the pattern I like) it still works.	2
The pad itself is waterproof which is great and easy to clean.  It's soft but still firm so it's easy to manage your unmanageable child while changing.	2
Face it, they're going to eat off the table.  This is a nice sanitary option for eating out, plus the pocket catches lots of food allowing it to be recycled rather than on the ground and thrown out.  It has a short useful life, but is indispensable during that time.	2
The sheet is nice and thick, great for added warmth in winter.  Others have complained about the elastic giving out but we have not experienced this in the 6 months we have been using it but the price has increased 50% since we purchased it.	2
So cute and well made.  My toddler likes to play with it and throws it around but it's been good for over a year now.	2
They are cute, and exactly what I expected.  no complaints and seem durable enough. considering ordering another set to finish out our changing table.	2
I like the scissors and the clippers, both work well.  The emery boards are way to rough, instead of being a fine grain for baby nails.	2
My 7 month old daughter loves this rattle.  We use the sassy links to attach it to everything so she doesn't throw it on the floor--her new favorite game.  My sister's son also has this (6 months) and he uses it daily as well.	2
This is soft and easy to install it'll help my baby from bumping his head. I love the size and fit	2
My 2.5 month old has been using this toy since he was born.  At first we just showed it to him and he'd stare at it for long periods of time. Now he likes to hold it =)	2
I searched high and low on amazon for some no-nonsense burp cloths that were cheap and plain.  These are great.  I use these all and am buying another set so I don't have to do laundry as often.  Babies spit up, breasts leak, drinks spill...these are perfect to have on hand for all those inevitable clean ups.	2
Before we found this, brushing our baby's teeth was a struggle. But she actually enjoys it when we brush her teeth with this toothbrush. Definitely recommend this!	2
Good product. Fit my medela swing pump so I save directly in fridge or freeze.	2
My little boy pretty much liked all the toys on the exersaucer but I still got this one so he could chew on it since he's teething. He plays with it all the time. I even carry it around with us in his carseat sometimes so he can play with it in the car.	2
We got this as a registry gift when our daughter was a week old. She loved it right away! The music, lights, fish action & bubbles mesmerize her in her crib. She's 9 weeks old now & the original batteries are still working. We also have the aquarium bouncer chair-another must-have item!	2
Serves the purpose and easy to wash and dry after each feed.	2
it fits great (size large, 12 months old ,23.5 lbs) and still roomy.although it does not hold pee (neither do the little swimmers)you can wear it as many times as you want and clorine won't damage them!!	2
great quality matches few pieces I got and love JJ Cole, It looks like you can not go wrong with them	2
We have this and the smell form dirty diapers escapes to easily when opened. I supposed if used for garbage same problem.  In addition the foot pedal is to close in so its hard to get normal size foot on it to press it.	2
These are great!  Both my almost 2 and almost 4 year old son and daughter love these.  They are comfortable to wear and have held up well.  Very toddler tough.  We did receive a pink pair in an order of two, so beware that's a real possibility.	2
Great add on item for the Nose Frida. The Nose Frida comes with 4 filters but it doesn't hurt to have more on hand.	2
Comfortable, secure, and covers enough. I use the straps so I can move around more while pumping. Absolutely love this bra.	2
These towels are thin while being absorbent and soft.  They are large enough for me to wrap up my newborn (currently 11.5 lbs) after her bath.  They are cute and are holding up well after two months of use.	2
These worked out perfectly for the sides in our DaVinci crib. Course it doesn't protect the actual rails, and baby has done a number on those, but the most visible parts of the crib are still good to go.	2
So many uses linking toys together, or to strollers, to  bouncy chairs, to car seats and to high chairs.  Hook together easily.	2
This crib is absolutely gorgeous! My husband put it together very easily and it seems to be made very well. The cinnamon color isn't too reddish or orange. It's just perfect!	2
This organizer is the best for all of your baby needs to have on hand. It is most convenient and useful in the baby's room. I would recommend all expectant mothers having it.	2
Not too much to say its just a changing pad. It fits the two different types of changing pad covers that I got from target and babies r us.	2
I was kinda exceptional when I saw it and the the adhesive pad idea wasn't  that appealing to me for your oven door, but I gotta tell, it works and it works surprisingly good ..	2
This is perfect for what we needed. We put it on top of a dresser to create a changing table. It is a great size and the sides make it feel more secure while I am changing the baby.	2
These are just like the Soothie pacifiers babies get in the hospital but in pretty girlie colors! I thought they were way cuter than the big Green one they give you!	2
One of the BEST things we've gotten since our daughter was born!! Would absolutely recommend to anyone... good price, and no boiling pots of water ;) Plus it only takes 4 mins (2 mins in microwave, 2 mins out of microwave) and you're good to go! Every new parent needs one of these!	2
I bought this to use for my 2nd son, primarily to attach to our Baby Bjorn bouncer (got the idea from Amazon reviews, actually). LOVE IT. Much cheaper than the Bjorn attachment, too. Baby L is mesmerized by it. I do a lot of research before buying toys/gear and the reviews really are legit for this item.	2
this is nice and light weight perfect for summer or houses that are warm. easy to get off and on the baby as well!	2
Perfect use it to wash, dry, and organize small parts works great for me would recommend to anyone! Time saver stable and pretty colors would help describe this product very satisfied!	2
This cute little whale has definitely saved our kid from a few incidents. I would buy it for any expectant mother.	2
Perfect for the diaper bag for when we eat out or have a playdate picnic. Will buy another set soon	2
These sleep sacks are wonderful! My granddaughter used them all winter....and where we're from, it gets very cold at night. She was snug as ever. Not too warm, not cold at all. I would HIGHY reccommend these to new parents. What a wonderful idea someone came up with....sleep with no worries about the blanket covering the infant's head!	2
My son is fully secured in this, the color is great looks just like the picture. Had trouble adjusting the harness because directions weren't clear, but FYI it's on bottom of the seat (front side)there's a handle etc, very easy you pull it in or out to adjust to your child's body. Overall happy with this purchase.	2
These spoons are great, I keep a few in a diaper bag, a few at grandmas - etc. I give one to my son as I feed him. Its a great set.	2
This is a great little baby toy.  I keep it on the changing table as a distraction for my baby. She can hold it with both of her little hands and loves to play with it.  Bonus for mommy - maching washable!	2
The tabby kitten wubbanub is very cute and helps the pacifier stay in place for my daughter. The main reason I like it is its very easy to keep track of instead of the tiny pacifiers that I keep losing around the house.	2
We have shower walls identical to that shown in the picture.  It has not fallen down once.  Very happy with product.  Just make sure you the follow directions to ensure the product does not fall.	2
My 1-year-old son loves these!  We play with them in the bath.  They stick to the tub and shower wall with water and we spell words out.  He also likes to carry them around the house. :)	2
Love it! I use it for over a month and love it! This drying rack has great drying capacity and does not take a lot of counter space. Love the spinning feature - so convenient!	2
I would highly recommend these bottles.  They work great and do not leak.  Have been very pleased with them.  Will be getting more if these ever stop working.	2
Useful for toys to not fall out if the stroller	2
As a new mom, I love anything washable that looks great and does the job. This covers are very thick and stylish.  They look great in my baby's car seat.  I've wash them once and they still look great.  So, if you don't see an update in the future it means they still look great.	2
Baby loves this product, it has two settings depending on how loud you want the volume, baby loves to watch the flashing lights and several different tunes on this cute little toy.	2
If you have the dr brown's products this is a must have. love that I can fit everything I need to on it	2
Love it a lot. My husband and I run a lot with our 5 mth yr old and it holds everything needed for the run. Keys, phones, baby bottle and stuff toy for the run. A must have!!	2
I've had these attached to my stroller for over a year now and use them everytime I go shopping to hold my shopping bags.  They work great and I've had no issues with them.	2
Works great as an alternative to a disposable liner.  It also has a tiny bit of absorbency and I use it (I just lay it on the inside of the diaper, I don't stuff it) with pocket diapers that are sometimes known to leak a little.	2
I got this one and now my kid chews the other sides of the crib. It is a huge help! Get all sides covered. I love how it's waterproof.	2
Best invention! a chair for my granddaughter that attaches to your own chair! And it is safer than what I used to have when my children were young (sassy seat that attached to the table) I have one at my house and she can sit at the table with us and play or eat.	2
Super convenient, rolls into a tiny tube, easy to use...all of the things something you're toting around in your diaper bag should be!!	2
This sprayer works great and cost far less than the name brand sprayers on the market. I highly recommend it!	2
If your child LOVES playing with the water coming from the faucet, THIS is the toy for you. It's fantastic, durable and doesn't seem to suck down battery power. I hope the seller brings it back PRONTO, as I'd like to buy some for other toddlers I know. (My 18-month-old LOVES it.)	2
My 11 month old STILL doesn't have teeth - but he loves when we brush his gums with this tiny little banana! It's a great, soft, and really bendable.	2
There is a nice feeling to the fabric of this sheet. It fits perfectly around the mattress even after washing.	2
These are super!  They never slip and are strong.  They seem a bit pricey, but they're well worth it.  I'm very happy with the purchase.	2
This toy seems to be decent quality offering several developmentally appropriate features that may interest your baby. The contrasting colors, sound, and different textures are all interesting to babies. Its small and easily portable for entertainment on the go. My 4 month old seems to enjoy it :-)	2
I love the pattern on this Pussy Willow boppy cover. On the solid pink side it is a very soft fleece-like material and on the print side it is fabric. Very cute and goes great with our Pottery Barn Penelope set.	2
For awhile this was hard to find.  Amazon had the best price.  It is compact and looks nice on the changing table.	2
My baby has no patience when I am changing the diaper, so the straps are a huge help. I love the product. I bought 2 so far.	2
Nice colors, good quality, ironing easy, love it, I am so happy with this product, and I use it alot	2
This is a great product for protecting your babies! We loved its quality and baby proofed our entire living room with it!	2
I breastfeed my son and decided at 6months old to jump to the level 2 nipple.  He seemed like he was getting frustrated with how slow the level 1 was.  I think it is has been a good decision.  I don't think we will go to a level 3 as he is happy.	2
I was glad to get this changing pad - it was the best price I could find.  The pad works great, wipes clean, and is exactly what I expected to get.	2
This is so comfortable & a must have for any pumping momma.  So glad I purchased it!!	2
I purchased this because I loved the stars, and wanted an Aden+Anais blanket. It is cute, and very versatile! We use it for swaddling, covering the carseat, to lay down on the floor/couch/bed for kick time, cuddling, etc. It is a perfect weight to be light when you need or to be doubled/tripled and warm. Love it!	2
I love these SO MUCH I've bought three packs.  They are the only bottles we use since my daughter has some major gas issues. :/  They have definitely made a world of difference, especially used along with the mixing pitcher.	2
Soft, comfy AND an adorable monkey!  How much more could one ask for from a towel? :-)	2
When the time comes that our baby is holding and shaking things, we'll be glad she's got this eco friendly toy to do so with.	2
I love these bibs.  They work well for catching food - lots of good coverage but still fit nicely.  They easily wipe down and launder up nicely.  I highly recommend these.	2
This product arrived on time and was easy to assemble. I recommend having C batteries on hand as soon as the package arrives because you will want to try this mobile out! Good quality and the animals are cute and colorful.	2
Nice pillow with good shape, it is very useful. I always lie down to watch tv, my husband love to use it too.	2
This is a great product. My daughter loves to chew on it when I'm holding her (especially when she is in her carrier and doesn't have much else to do). I have 2 dogs that shed a lot and their hair does NOT stick to this item like others. I recommend this product to buyers.	2
I bought these to take on a trip.  It was such a convenient way to sterilize bottles & pacifiers while out of town.  Each bag has the directions printed on it, so you can just throw 1 in your diaper bag & take it with you anywhere.	2
Our daughter used this toy frequently from 4-12 months of age.  She enjoyed chewing on it and it proved easy for her to grasp. She used it less frequently after 12 months, but she still pulls it out on occasion to throw it around and hear the ball rattle inside.	2
This support pillow is excellent. It is the perfect size, and it prevents the baby from getting a flat head.	2
these washcloth are perfect for my lo. front side is a little rougher than the back side, back side is soft though.	2
These are the ONLY bottles my baby will drink from.  I introduced the bottle at 5 weeks and almost felt defeated after trying another brand popular for breastfeed babies.  After shopping around and looking at nipples, I tried these and my baby loves these!!	2
These are fantastic and my little one just loved them.  They smell like vanilla and she takes them over any other teether that she has.	2
I like sassy's rattles beccause they don't contain any harmful paint. Who wants their baby sucking on paint?Rattle sounds great, and its easy for my 2 month old to hold onto!	2
Do not spend any more then you need to on a pack an play. My baby slept in this for 4 month and now uses it during the day.  The color is great for a girl or boy since its like a soft blue. Very nice product at a great price.	2
Easy to clean, won't melt in the dishwasher or microwave and my kids can't break it.  What could possibly be more perfect?  You must get these.	2
This crib is beautiful, and I love it. It wasn't too difficult to put together and it looks great in our nursery. Amazon really does have it for the best price (I looked everywhere), plus free shipping on such a large item was wonderful. It came undamaged and well packed.	2
I got this items today and it was exactly as described. I could not find a fun brush and comb set for my son of 3 months. He could not take his eyes off of it today! Truly a cute usable item for his nursery. :)	2
When mom tosses me in the bath, I like to stand up and try to yank my whale off of the faucet. He never comes off....so I usually give up and nibble on him and throw my rubber ducky at him. All in all, he lives up to my expectations. Buy it, baby. You won't regret it.	2
These are great for the little ones when you take them out to eat. Easy to set up, easy to clean up (which the restaurant staff appreciate).	2
I love that these are the thick cotton washcloths instead of the carters ones that are soft, however they are some kind of blend that feels too cheap. When I was my son with these I feel like I'm really getting all his chubby folds clean.	2
