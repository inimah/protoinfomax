I was a fan from Soul Edge PS1 to Soul Calibur 3 PS2Graphs changed a lot to worseMovements are quite differentCharacter design is quite oddMusic unspectacular.Story mode sucks, Man I loved the one back on SC3SC 5 in the other hand... WOW	1
Wow look at the pretty engine. THere I have said everyhting good about this. I swear progreammers are more interested in pretty than contenet.  I would rather play Doom than this.  Quake3 is all glitz and no depth. Where  is the story? Where? It left with Romero when he went to form IonStorm	1
The PC version is gimped and missing console and dedicated servers. The online play is totally unplayable unless everyone has 4 bars. If you try to play with yellow bars you're screwed because it will lag horribly.	1
When my printer prints, there are blank lines in the middle of the picture. Doesn't work. Can't fix it either.	1
I hate this game, it has 2 more parts and the story doesn't make sense, it's super hard! and makes you epileptic, because you don't know what to do!!	1
I'm a girl who is into beautiful graphics. This one just did not thrill me.I want to kindly thank you for your sending this game in a timely fashion,but I just was not thrilled The graphics were too flat,and I had too many corridors to deal with.I should have chosen better.	1
Everyone has different skills at video games. I am not very good. I found it too difficult and therefore more frustrating than fun. It would have been fun for me if it had two lower difficulty levels: easy and very easy.	1
As I'm unable to "fully" review this game, let me just say, the game is not compatible with WIN XP.  If you are lucky (or foolish) enough to still be running Win 98, then you may be able to get the game to load.	1
I am very disappointed with this item as both batteries will not hold a charge for more than an hour. not sure why as my other Microsoft batteries work great. The ones I had before are the white and black ones. why are the pink any different?	1
Plain and simple.  I will not buy this game as long as the DRM is part of the deal.  I am not a criminal.  I will not be treated like one to play a game.	1
I don't get the love for this game.  "Lame" is what they should call it.	1
I had to return this game because of the WAC19.cab digital error so I cannot review at this time.  This is a common error with this game as I have read on the internet.  I will try to find an error free game as all the ND games are a great experience.	1
did not like to hard to do . ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;  ; ; ; ;	1
Poor graphics, long load times... an Age of Empire's knock off with poor graphics.  All your characters look the same.Not very fun or impressive.  Save yourself some frustration and get a NEWER game :)Grade:  F-	1
Well this turned out to be a waste of money. Just a little kids game, can't aim and very limited control over your character. I quit after about 30 minutes and will not play it again. Will try to find some kid that will play it and give it to them.	1
Stick to the PSP 3000.  It is a better value and the lameness of the go will make you want to go.	1
This game got boring within 20 minutes of playing it. Mario is starting to grow stale unfortunately. Could have been better.	1
that pretty much sums it up sometimes its just about impossible to get on wifi for multiplayer and its just the same ol shooter game..... Goldeneye 007 is a far better game... totally not worth it.	1
Game has major issues on Win.7-64.I have tried 3 times to work around bugs and controls with little success.Game will freeze,unable to save if I get thru a portion without trouble.	1
Why not to buy:Game is very slowAfter playing for a while, the game actually freezesBuggy as all get outTook out many great features in previous gamesThe graphics AREN'T better!  You have to turn all the graphics options DOWN COMPLETELY in order to get the game to run on your computer.MAXIS/EA bombed this one, DON'T BUY IT!!!	1
A friend gave me money to order this for him. I personally didn't like this game. It's the worst in the Double Dragon series.	1
Do not buy this! You can download the files for a boot disc from the Internet (this is not illegal, the developer gives it away) and burn them yourself to a standard CD-R. This will allow you to play any import that you would like.Fear not America, you will play Shenmue II.	1
The action is good but the awful story made me wish I would have rented this game. Russians should be offended by it and demand an apology. Get Uncharted 2 instead.	1
This really stinks.My cousin has it and he likes it.But the buttons are too far away.THIS STINKS!!!!Dont buy it.THIS STINKS!!!!!!	1
I paid 400 dollars for 2 hardware malfunctions and xbox games.  I see a little advance in the graphics, but its not that much at all.  It still DVD format and doesn't hold enough.  Hold off for the Revolution or Playstation 3 when the real next generation begins.	1
This controller feels like you are holding a big rock. There is no comfort in it! The buttons are also hard to reach if you have small hands-no, scrub that, if your hands aren't the size of a regular pumpkin.	1
i found this at a resale shop for $2 im glad i didn't buy it on amazon for $10. This was the worst game i ever played. It was so bad you would't believe it. Please take my word for it and don't buy this game and waste your money.	1
Flying a Helicopter around and saving people never seemed any fun to me. It would have been better if it was a car game I think.	1
This game is a HUGE let down.  It is awful and in no way is an improvement on the first Saint's Row.  That's probably why there was not a big PR event on the release of this game.  Do NOT waste your money buying this game!	1
THIS PROVIDER ME cheated, NEVER ARRIVED THIS REQUEST ME SEVERAL YEARS HAVE PASSED YOU BUY TODAY AND DECIDED TO REPORT IT BY SCAMMER ... AMAZON IS RESPONSIBLE AND HAVE TO REMOVE THIS PROVIDER LICENSE TO SELL NO MORE ...	1
Popped it into my N64 and tried to use it.  Was immediately taken to a screen telling me that the memory card was broken and would not work.  Gunna try getting another memory card like this brand new hopefully that one works as I need a memory card in order to play Turok Rage wars	1
this thing lasted less time than my oringal battery, but needed more time to charge than my old battery did.	1
These guys need to wise up and stop putting those drivers in their games.  The only thing it hurts is legitimate owners.  My last hard drive, Spellforce 1 decided my DVD burner was illegitimate and so started corrupting files; wonderful.  Spent 40 bucks for something that ate my computer.	1
this game sucks do not buy it stay away is they only thing i can tell you and just get 4 for they xboox360 or they PS3	1
I don't understand the good reviews of this game.  Basically run around killing, dying, killing, dying , boss rinse repeat.  So monotonous and repetitious.  Boring landscapes that are all the same.  Feels like its 20 years out of date.  If you play a game for entertainment, then don't get this.	1
Get (or rent) this game for the single-player campaign only...the multiplayer just sucks.So what if 24 are supported on a map, you'll be lucky to get 5 or 6 other people.Everyone else is onCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which is what you should invest your $$ in instead!!	1
Only played it a few times and hurried to find a sucker to dump it on. It in no way compares to the realism of Major League Baseball 2K8.	1
Halo 1 and Halo 2 are icons of the video game industry(rightfully so).But Halo 3 ( and all after it) just don't have the same playful and lighthearted feel of the first  two Halo games.Hardcore fans may enjoy it, otherwise steer clear and play Halo 1 or Halo 2 again.	1
bad graphics even for a gba game,controlls that are not very responsive,  and a card battle system that sucks and is hard to use, I'll stick with the first two on the ps2 that are goodThis review may only legally be shown directly on Amazon.com	1
I found this &#34;Teen&#34; rated game to be very offensive;not only is it cavalier about the mass taking of human life butthey even have the characters act out as sultry types whoexpress &#34;sexy&#34; emotions when they kill someone;EA likes to press the envelope with bad language.  This gamemade me want to vomit from the AI commentaries.	1
only get this game if it's free my friend and i both have gamecubes and we couldnt wait for this game. my friend bought it the day it came out (full price it's not worth it) it's is utter crap everything is crap about this game id have a sexchange b4 id buy this game	1
What a bad game! It stinks! The create a sims is half way decent...but it still stinks. Controls stink, furniture stinks, graphics are decent.IF YOU WANT FUN BUY SIMS 2 FOR THE PC!!!	1
Don't get me wrong Sim City 2000 was great I loved it.  But this game is just Sim City 2000 with better graphics.  Thats all I have to say.  Im mad I bought it when I already have Sim City 2000.  Oh yea you can not make farms, I tried, its imposible.	1
There is a big chance that after you buy this expensive faulty system .... in a couple months..it won't work. If you've got money or time to waste go ahead. I see red rings in your future!!	1
Got to be the cheapest, worst graphics I have ever seen in years! Looks like scenery is painted on a flat piece of cardboard. The control is terrible. The bouncy, bouncy motion is just too stupid for words.What a waste of time.	1
Gave this game about 3 hours of my time. It was 2 boring and I just didn't like the control setup.	1
In my opinion the Rootkit/Starforce copy protection goes far beyond copy protection and flirts with being malicious software that is hidden on your computer when X3 is installed. Just Google Rootkit/Starforce and read a bit about what they are putting on your computers.	1
awful game poor graphics, don't like it at all...my son hates it... stay away from it...awful game awful game awful game	1
This game is just race and get new cars. One of the most boring games ever. Flashy cars, great graphics, but no interesting features what so ever. I have Project Gotham 1 and 2. I got bored of them after 2 days. Take my advice, theres better games out there! Later.	1
o.k. its called blood wake wheres the blood and a 7 yr old could beat this game easily I should know I watched one play this game sucks	1
Any person behind the development of this piece of junk deserves to be kicked in the jewels.And the graphics are so outdated, that members of their family should also get kicked in the jewels.I would also like to see the executives that approved this garbage forced to hold their eyes wide open as spitting King Cobras spray them repeatedly.	1
THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE WORST WWE GAME EVER CREATED. THANK GOD FOR THQ. IF THQ CAME IN ALL THE WWE GAMES WOULD HAVE SUCKED REALLY BAD. DON'T RENT THIS GAME, DON'T BUY THIS GAME, DON'T EVEN ASK FOR IT. THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS, THE VOICE OVERS SUCK, CREATE A CHARACTER SUCKS. EVERYTHING FOR THIS GAME SUCKS. DON'T BUY IT.	1
said it was 240v blew as soon as i pluged it in.  got a replacement from the seller and same thing on the second one.	1
well since i cant install it i guess its the worst game i ever had!!!! i never had such a bad experience installing a game before, i get a meassege from steam that i cant install the game because it hasnt been released!!!	1
To be quite honest, I found this to be the most tedious role-playing game I've ever played. The narrative sequences are ridiculously long, the graphics are mediocre, and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed. I read a lot of good reviews of this game before I bought it, and I was terribly disappointed.	1
You'd think for a total of $58.29, it would come with a freakin' cord and pairing instructions!  Had to use the cord from another controller and look up pairing instructions on a forum.	1
Im sure EQ2 will have plenty of pretty graphics, but the fact remains that SOE will still be the business behind the game, which means crappy support, lots of bugs, and many upgrades that you must pay for to support their company.I played EQ for 5 years, and will count myself out of this one.	1
These games are very hard to play and figure out. Most of them you almost have to cheat to finish them. Just like on one of them you have to set you alarm clock to a specific time to catch a late night clue.	1
I didn't really care for it that much it was boring....	1
Boring and the levels are dumb!Every walk around collect game was better than this one!!! Seriously don't waste your time or money	1
in this game all battles are fought by using cards, no beating the crap out of your enemys with the key blade.  This is an awful mess, skip this game and skip kh re:coded and play the other kh games in the series, they are much better	1
My best advise is to never buy a memory card online! I couldn't save at all with out it needing to be reformatted each time. I suggest not to buy memory cards online.	1
This game reezeed a lot. And it is vary hard to play.This is a big dissapontmit.	1
Bought this brand new from Amazon and I received a defective pedal like others mentioned. The cord is already rotted through, sticky, and the plastic is crumbling off. What a cheap product, blame the manufacturer... It's a shame but I have to return it.	1
Its nice to have a good vintage cars to drive, but the game its boring, its not a game I would recommend...	1
this game is so boring, don't get confused this is nothing like the other kirby games. It's in the style of tetris. and it gives tetris a bad name. This was a disapointment.If you liked this game check out all of the other kirby games	1
Jak 2 has got to be the worst game I have ever played, it has horrible gameplay, storyline, graphics and it just is crappy! I hope you dont waster your money on it! (...)	1
This game has not aged well at all. Quite frankly the quality of final fantasy games has been waning. This game is just boring as hell.	1
The Age of Empires: Mythology cartridge I got was full of programming errors: the AI couldn't handle the Norse. The game would crash... and if a player finished the battle it would not calculate the score correctly. Did they do a recall? The game was clearly defective.	1
This game went from one of the best games that i have ever played, to the worst game i have ever played. Sony has the worst customer service anyone has ever seen. They treat their customers like pieces of dog poo. Don't let them abuse you, avoid this game like you avoid your ex girlfriend!	1
This game, when I received it, did not work with my Wii consul.The seller provided me a full refund.I wish I could have gotten to play it.	1
The program gets lost in the tutorials and can't correct itself.  If you can't do exactly what the program says to do when the program says to do it, the only way out is to crash the plane and restart the flight.  Thus, one is unable to make any progress.It looked so great, too...	1
Do yourself a favor and play PacMan.  It'll be more challenging and last longer.	1
I was going to write a well though out review about how this DRM is just ridiculous.  But so many people have said it so well before me.  Please read though the 1 star reviews.  Just wanted to add my voice to the din... not buying because of DRM.  Screw UBI.	1
I received this as a gift for Christmas last year for my sons' wii. This worked great for a while, but unfortunately the batteries would no longer charge after about 7 months. The light just blinks red on the charger and wont charge at all. I'm a little surprised, I expected better quality from the energizer brand	1
I don't like this game. The save system is terrible. I probably will never play it again.	1
While the game itself is enjoyable to play, the DRM that ships with it is very difficult to deal with.  I bought it to use on two computers, just to play with a friend at my house.  Unfortunately, this will not work.	1
Si Doom 3 te parecio poco preparese para ese nuevo FPS. FEAR es un juego reciente ke porta no solo uno de los motores graficos mas exquisitos, sino tambien una tematica de survival/horror nunca antes vista digna de una produccion de hollywood. La accion y el miedo se combinan perfectamente para proporcionar una experiencia llena de adrenalina.	1
the game came in and had another persons name in white out on it and didnt even work. waist of my cash.	1
This game will not run properly.It runs for about 2 seconds then stops and starts again then runs again for about 2 seconds.	1
If you're by any means a seroius gamer, this is definitely a big waste of your time. I'm not quite sure whether it's rated "M" or "T", but it's a silly game, based on characters from other games and the whole thing doesn't make much sense.	1
This game is not creative or challenging. It does not offer a lot of thought and becomes quite boring and is now gathering dust on a shelf.	1
Game is pretty good in it's self, but it will not run in widescreen even with a HEX Edit, or any other edit of any kind. I would get the 360 version if I were you.	1
Cable doesn't cost this much.  You are getting ripped off.  Please don't buy these, they are at least 5X overpriced.	1
This CD messed up my PC, and my PC has not been the same since I purchased it.  It also tries to download other stuff onto my computer without my permission.  Would never buy these items again.	1
It is a total waste of money. The design of this game is very bad. Poor graphics make it hard to find evidences.  Navigation is difficult. The cases are not interesting at all. This is one of the worst Xbox 360 games I ever have.	1
Was not really impressed by this Got it just because but the New Kinect just blows this so hard out of any consideration really	1
The game is great, enjoyable and really beautiful, however it came with a card to register the game and in Square Enix word, those codes were disabled, and will not be enabled again, nor replaced to fit their new format.	1
CHEESY GRAPHICS BAD SOUNDTRACK WARNING: MAY CAUSE DEPRESSIONIT IS HORRIBLE!!...	1
PaRappaTheRappa 2 is not only a tremendously long title,but a pice of trash.It's about this midget dancing dog.He gets a life time supplies of noodles.(um....)And that's all he thinks about.there's 3 words to describe this game:NOODLES-DANCING-LAMEWhatever you don't buy this game!!!Unless you like midget dogs in a rapper outfit that dances.sincerly,kenny	1
Title says all.  You'd know how bad Mario Kart Wii is if you have even played the older Mario Karts.  Mario Kart 64, Double Dash, and DS were the best.  Wii is just a stupid gimmick for little kids and this wheel shows how.  Pathetic.	1
Starts off ok for the first Two or Three puzzles, then it becomes impossible to solve the puzzles, again, no choice of skill level.	1
This game is what we call "broken." Sudoku only works properly if each puzzle has a single, unique solution, and the player can find that solution based on the puzzle presented. Sudoku Mania is broken because its puzzles do not have unique solutions. To add insult to injury, the interface is pretty awful, too.	1
this game is terrible did Nintendo hire George Lopez to make a flying Mario game but he was drunk do not get this extermly horrible game!	1
A horrible game that features all the top stars of the defunct company and no ring whatsoever.	1
You can't even buy a digital download of this game from Steam or Direct2Drive without the same DRM scheme. Having an internet connection at all times...I'd understand if the DRM actually stopped pirates. But it doesn't.I'd wait for the bargain bin on this one. Or just get a Xbox360/PS3.	1
Didn't really like it..  Certainly not what i thought it was going to be.  The graphics and game play kinda sucked...	1
I don't like using the word stupid to describe this game, but honestly, it kind of is. The game doesn't test you on any skill; I feel like most of it's luck. I got it out of the library, and it was pretty much a waste of time. It was really boring and pointless.	1
game keeps freezing the case was cracked. That was just horrible  man .That was a waste of my time and money	1
The quality of this product is sub par.  This was my 3rd 360 and this one lasted about six months.  I ended up sending it to Microsoft for a repair, then sold it.	1
My daughter had to replace it for the one she had before  for her nintendo game cube console and it is very good and useful cable.	2
This product is excellent and it brought the plastic cover, also brought a pair of batteries what let you use it immediately	2
THIS GAME WAS OUT FOR A WHILE WHEN I FINALLY GOT IT. I WAS TOTALLY SURPRISED AT HOW COOL IT IS WITH BLOOD AND GORE AND STUFF. YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS GAME.I CERTAINLY DO.	2
If your a fan of Batman or superheros or action games, this is a must have,  Great Characters, Great Story, Impressive Graphics and fun to play. easy Controls	2
This is another gift of the Nancy Drew series that I've gotten for my teenager granddaughter who just loves these games.	2
haven't play for long time and love this game as enjoy play. it good play game I guess well alright	2
This is a crazy game. I've had this for a while. Been tearing it up. Played a demo of 2010 the other day, so I bought it last nite. cant wait for it to come. This is a tight game. The moves are realistic..	2
Party formation, story depth, quests complexity, NPCs interaction. No role playing game even some of the recent great ones, come close to Baldur's Gate 2 depth and length.	2
Star Fox 64 is a beloved entry in of Nintendo's most famous franchises. The remake is amazing, really making the game incredibly good looking. The gameplay is great, and fans of the rail-shooting genre should definitely make this part of their 3DS library.	2
recommend thisthey all liked iti got it for 2 7r olds and they never put it downwould recommend this	2
I'm a big golf fan! This game is great. It's graphically pleasing, and has lots of replay value. So far the best portable golf game to date. Can't wait to see the 2006 version next year.	2
final fantasy crystal chronicles is the greatest video game in the world a true classic the best of the best square-enix are gods they are the greatest video game company in the world buy this game if your a huge final fantasy fan you wont be sorry	2
IF YOU LOVED SEGA BACK IN THE DAY, YOULL LOVE THIS GAME...JUST LIKE DR. MARIO....REMEMBER THAT ONE? THIS GAME STILL HOLDS YOUR ATTENTION, AND YOU CAN PLAY IT FOR HOURS....	2
This product is awesome for people who cant afford a bigger battery for your psp.. It gives me 2 extra hours, 4 hours normal, when i charge it up with the product attached it gives me 2 more hours, plus the grip makes it easy to play games without cramping..	2
Cool game - I really like the story. It explains it well. It is nothing like the game play from FF7, so be sure to expect more like a gun shooting game. Love the graphics for it's time.	2
Disney can't make a bad anything, this game is awesome i love the story, Characters and the action in this game. Kingdom hearts is a must play must own game. This is probably Disney's Best game yet.	2
So glad my brother bought this and was stuck on CoD at the time it came in. I'm not even sure if he has played it.	2
i like this game alot go but it right now u will thank me for it later. this is a short game but the gameplay is great the guns are cool and the missions are the best.	2
This a great little device. It can be used with latest Zelda Game (which is also great) or with Training Game included.  My children love it.	2
Well, to make a long story short, it came in perfectly, and worked perfectly. I  give this audio cord two thumbs up!!	2
These are nice expecially for younger ones to get the feel of the actual game itself.  It is a soft nerf so won't do any damage.	2
Great quality cable for a great price. I am currently using it on my PS2 and the graphics look much better than normal RGB. The quality of the cable and plugs is top notch but I wouldn't expect less from Sony.	2
Snake Eater was a HUGE improvement over MGS2. This game pushed the PS2 to its limits and made it do things no one knew it was capable of. Subsistence comes with all the extras that die-hard fans are going to love. This is a must own for your PS2 collection!!!!	2
Worth the money and works just fine.I had no troubles and it shiped very fast.I would recommend this product.	2
star wars rogue squadron is hands down the best n64 game ever made get this game even if you're not a star wars fan you wont regret it	2
Although the description said used it turned out to be a new copy haha thank you!! And for 15$ that's really cheap and it came on an original 2008 gta 4 box none platinum hits	2
With all the reviews on here, there is nothing more I can add - only my 5 star rating.  This is absolutely the best game out there for a family to play together and have hours on end fun.	2
This game is SOOOOOOOOOOOO awesome! It is one of the best games on the system. In this game you are a farmer, but you can also get married and have a child. You have to be a guy farmer, but it's still fun even if you're a girl. This is a great game for anyone!	2
It improved many issues from the original Pokemon pinball, and still played mostly like its predecessor, I recommend this game.	2
DON'T LISTEN TO THE GHOST RECON HATERS BECAUSE THEY HAVNT EVEN PLAYED IT BUT I HAVE AND IT IS GREAT TRUST ME.	2
Does what it says it does bought it because we needed another ds charger there isnt anything more to say about it	2
This is simply the best baseball game ever made. Is it perfect? No, but it's close.Everything it does, it does well. Hitting takes some practice, but after awhile it comes pretty easy. AI seems excellent. Graphics are great. The game will online and download the latest rosters for all the teams.  ...Just get it.	2
We love our wheels, especially for Mario Cart.  It is the same wheel that comes with the Mario Game Package deal.  It is simple to insert your controller and very sturdy.  Amazon is the best to offer it for only 10 bucks!  Don't pass it up.  FUN!	2
The game is great with lots of shooting and interrogate for answers. Don't listen to the other reviews, because they do not have the right requirements.I have a permanent wireless connection on a Macbook pro.	2
love this game, so many games on it, challenging	2
Tales of Vesperia is a RPG and anime that will amaze you by either the story or characters and their personalities.The game is not so difficult when you only try to play and resolve the main quests... there are plenty of secret quests that may not be so straight forward to identify... great game!	2
Excellent game. I bought it intended it for a child audience and ended up loving it mysel. Who would have touht rolling up the world could be so fun!	2
My family and I are playing this almost all day andhaving so much fun with the game.  It was a very good purchase and we will be buying again from Amazon.com	2
Does the job. I used them for the smaller Genesis or the genesis 2 for my high def tv and it has never looked better.	2
fun game to play, easy controls, sometimes a tad frustrating when you not told exactly what to do. game came as described and works wonderfully.	2
FEAR is inarguably one of the best games in 2006. With its complex and detailed story proves a new group of game fans to appreciate this great first-person shooting game. The add-on pack, what can I say, just an upper level of fun add to the original game.	2
I've always wanted a camo pattern legit official PS controller. It's the coolest thing ever. I lost it in my carpet right away. As for the terrible reviews... Buy from a legit seller (i.e. Amazon) and you will not be disappointed. Oh and to make them work properly, charge completely before you ever press the PS button.	2
This controller is simply amazing and makes playing the classic games more fun.  You can even use this for games like Mortal Kombat where a traditional controller is better suited.	2
my family loved this game it is very fun but diffucult at times. I was the only one to actually ebat it in my family but since I only did it once while no one was around they don't belive me but i did	2
It came in on time and looks almost identical to the original.  These are a slight greenish gray color while the original is just grey.  They fit perfect and work without a hitch!	2
Loved it, the lights at the tip are awesome, my son was really glad to get this as a christmas present	2
This game is way more fun than I can imagine.  It's like tactics 3D with no well defined square.  It will keep you on for several hours.  It did to me.  I don't play anymore because I don't have much time to do anything anymore.	2
For those who compred this game with COD4... You are way wayyyy wrong... This is a totally different game... It cant be compared with COD4 because they have different themes.... modern vs. WW2 soooo this game is the best in its theme so BUY iTTT its a great game don't listen to those who complained about it...	2
This is one of the best video games ever created, no question.  I played it numerous times to earn all of my dog tags.  I only wish they would have made this for the PC.......Overall = Superb	2
we love this game and play it every day. My husband,grandson and I play golf the most but I like baseball and bowling best	2
I have been wanting to play a game that reminded me of my youth. and this was just that, I really love the ability to &#34;bubble&#34; to save your character as I am not an avid gamer	2
This is a great game, but beware: Henry Hatsworth is really, truly, unbelievably hard. It's an accomplishment to beat this game. I like that.You can almost get into Prince of Persia kind of flow while playing this game, the controls are responsive, and the bosses are memorable. All in all, its a very challenging, addictive and great game.	2
Great game and only 5 bucks at gamestop, this is an awesome game, get it used at gamestop for only 5 bucks	2
He played this over his Aunts house and liked it. He watched the trailer for Saints Row 2 and decided he wants to play both and likes them better than the newer Grand Theft Auto games.	2
I love all things mario this is a good game challenging  levels keeps you going for months good game for the money	2
My husband & I, both, have DS'es and we wirelessly link up and play this game almost every night - it's fun AND addicting!  The play-alone story version is fun & challenging, too!  I highly recommend this game to anyone - young & old!	2
It seems like my grandson never would charge his PS3 controllers until the next time he wanted to play a game. I bought this charger from Amazon and got him to start putting the controllers on charge when he stops playing a game and now he has been a lots happier with the results.	2
This product met my expectations and was good quality and a good price. No complaints, I felt like I got a good deal. Great games	2
This is one of the greatest game I have played on my PS3 that I own, and I am proud that I do. So far I have played a whole hour because of School.	2
I bought this game for my son who really loves it. The graphics are great and this game is fun to play. It is a little more challenging than the original version.	2
Excellent Game.  Great story line.	2
We boguht it for my Son's Bithday  He loves it  We also bought World 3 but some one stold it so got to replace it	2
I'm a FF fan.  But even if I wasn't I would have turned into one after this game.  My sister and friends sit around watching me play it as if there's a movie on.The modifications from the older final fantasy series is amazing and the added speach gives it exactly what it lacked.It's a must have.	2

If you've played any PlayStation console in the past fifteen years, you've more than likely used a DualShock controller. What else can be said? It's a good controller design. Works with any PlayStation.	2
Silent Hill 2 is without a doubt the best survival horror  game ever and Silent Hill 3 is just as great. With new weapons and new monsters you will love this game just as much as Silent Hill 2	2
Big Twisted Metal family here, great edition to the others, has already provided hours of fun for the whole family.  Don't hesitate, get twisted	2
i got this game basically because it was from Rockstar, at the beginning was kind of different, but once you understand it is greatttt.	2
I bought my play & charge kit last year... my battery was good for one year and a half... or close to this...I just got my replacement battery! Works fine! Still a good acquisition!	2
I think that this is the best way to get points. Fast and easy. No shipping when buying online code and have it is seconds.	2
There may not be the flashing graphics, and voice sound as Halo 3, but this game sure rocks. You should definatly buy it.	2

dear god the shear scope of uncharted 2 was amazing, all over the world and then some , heck i'd call it a mix between a mountain climbing sim, die hard and bioshock infinite, cannot wait to play uncharted 3	2
I played part 2 before part 1. Now I have to play part one I enjoy playing an entire series. The story line so far is amazing its not overly dramatic and grown up and is great childish fun.	2
Of course this was purchased for my kids and they loved it! Who doesnt love Mario? and as an added bonus he races!! Nintendo got this one right!!	2
This was a gift for my son.  I know he and his friends have thoroughly enjoyed it and he has recommended it to many people.	2
This game blows you away and on top of that there are cool mods for it doing move so cool as this its more of a interactive movie in short you have to play this but dont get the xbox or play station version just trust me on this :)	2
Everybody said COD4 is a nice game, so I decided try it. Yes, It is a nice FPS game for PC finally. Graphic is good, gameplay is fun, surprising story, upexpected ending. Overall it is a very nice game for PC again. The only thing I recommended is a different story ending. COD4 worth a play. Try it !	2
With all the instruments, this game is amazing. It feels like you're actually in a band when you play it. The songs are pretty good in this game. The games story mode is a fun way to increase your skill and buy accessories for your character. I recommend it.	2
I got this games I wanted to play the Assassin Creed series from part 1 to all the way to part 3. Good game over all.	2
It opens new possibilities of gameplay.The best part is that it feels natural compared to what the competition offers, snce is very accurate.The best part is that outside few games, this is not forced on the players so if you simply want to play in a more traditional way you still can do it	2
I ordered this for my husband. He plays it often. My son even likes it. They both play it together.	2
I got this game when i was in 4th grade and it has stuck with me ever since the game is amazing nothing else to say	2

This game is by far the best wrestling game I've ever played. It is complete with everything, the roster, the costumes, the season. Shame this isn't available for PS3, it be awesome!	2
grand theft auto is back better than ever.You are a gang member that work for gangs to win money,there are are a variety of weapons like handguns,shotguns,baseball bat,uzi,and rocket launchers.You can steal any car rockstar also added subways,boats,and airplanes to ride.	2
These games are very close to the original board games. I really enjoy playing them when I am somewhere that I have to wait, I just pull it out of my purse and play. It is nice to have a choice of games in just one cartridge.	2
There's not much to say about this product. It's the original AC cable, so it performs as it should and does what it's supposed to.	2
amazing ground breaking game fps good grafics good sound for the guns and over all great game it was a little short but solid game	2
A sony classic. If you want this game buy the Killzone trilogy. Killzone 3 has better multiplayer, eyegasm visuals, but this is still worth buying for the single player.	2
Mass Effect is a great R.P.G. I bought the collection, the only problem i had with this one was the save system was aggravating at times, when expected an auto save after a long battles I did not get one, but other than that, this game is a must have!	2
I play this game all the time and i absolutely love it!! it came with all DLCs and Maps because it was game of the year edition!	2
This game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time's but when you get all your force power's it is SO F***ING FUN you can cut everybody's arm's off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool.	2
We love Nancy Drew Mysteries and play them together -- this one was a good challenge, puzzles were great, and we played it pretty quickly with no hints.  I would recommend it.	2
The white P3 dual shock controller is truly awesome you need to own one to understand....	2
This is by far one of the best "First person shooter" games on the Wii system. If you get confused with the buttons on the other systems, this is the cure for you. All you have to do is point and shoot, without the extra accessories.	2
