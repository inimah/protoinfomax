Weakest of all his works including no limit, maybe 2 or 3 good songs. this was when Snoop sold out Pac'. Never respected him since then. Sell out.	1
YO THIS ALBUM IS WACK SON,IT BELONGS TO A TRASH BIN RATHER THAN MY CLASSIC CLOSET WHICH IS FILLED WITH  HIP HOP RELEASED B/W 1991 &amp; 1995(GOLDEN ERA) HIP HOP IS DEAD WORD.(1988-1995 GOLDEN ERA) (1997-PRESENT WACK ERA).	1
IN YOUR FACE NON-MATURE MUSIC. here is my review:Me and my home-boys love listening to this album. Even though I'm not black, I don't listen to music, and I'm an idiot.	1
This album is crap. There was only one good song on the whole album. Don't waste your money on this album like I did. Just buy the single of &quot;P.I.M.P.&quot;	1
this band sux badly i can't believe that crap is still coming from them i would rather shoot my self then listen to that craptoo bad i had to give this crap one star	1
okay this does 2pac injustice, these songs are all bootlegs, we all heard them before, the producers remixed these underground classics took the rawness off of them and made pac go mainstream why? i mean do anybody believe pac would have sampled journey do yourself a favor and get the bootlegs instead cause is the real one.	1
Primus sucks! I'm serious. They do. Do they even have a bassist? Oh, yeah, they do. Les Claypool or some redneck name like that. It's so hard to hear him! All you can hear is extremely simple basslines. Do yourself a favour and check out "St. Anger" if you want some killer bass.	1
Along with bands such as The Hives,and The White Stripes,this man is destroying rock music with his lame lyrics.Just listen to Wasted and Ready,because when he sang these songs,he was wasted but he never was ready.Avoid these bands at all costs.	1
It's amazing how these guys keep fooling people. I ask you: do they write their songs? Or some clever professional songwriter do that for them? I have absolutely nothing against ballads and pop, but when that sounds a  complete fake, that pisses me off!	1
Total garbage.  I've never heard such trash.	1
there's nothing new that hasn't been done already.the beats have been done before a thousand times.this disc is 2nd rate Badu&amp;Bliege.Amel has a good voice but this Material is Lacking anything New.	1
this album is wannabe gangsta rap garbage.  i don't understand why people say 50 cent brought back gangsta rap, the only he brought back was crap.  this album isn't even worth 50 cents.  the only thing good about this album is eminems verses.  don't buy this album, it's absolutely the worst album of 2003.	1
i just wanna say that some one iz a dum@$$ jay z and dmx aint on murder inc they actually good you cant be good if your on murder inc dmx is on ruff ryders and def jam and jay z is on roc a fella and def jam get it right	1
"Crocodile Rock" is surely one of the most annoying tunes ever to hit the radio, and it is the main hit on this album. OK, "Daniel" was also a hit, and is tolerable, but the rest of this album reeks. Elton John is vastly overrated.	1
I bought this on the strength of the reviews, but I'm not happy. The bass is dominant throughout the entire cd, sometimes even pushing vocals to the background. I know some people really like a strong bass mix, but if you like more balance, you won't like this.	1
david cross once said, "these guys sound like they stood outside of 7th grade girl gym locker rooms and wrote down what they overhear and put it in their music" david, thank you for summing it up in an easy understanding way for all of us	1
This album is proof that time yields better results.  This sounds like DMX made it in one day.  It really ain't good at all.  Their are a few dope songs, but as an album, this one is garbage.  Dark and Hell Is Hot is leagues and bounds better than this [one].	1
this is the worst cd i have in my cd collection men in black the soundtrack is better than this peice of ***!!!!	1
This is the same old ja rule on this album.Weak beats and ridiculous lyrics with an annoying voice.He claims to be gangster but in reality he is just a black justin timberlake.He needs to retire from music and movies because he stinks.DO NOT SUPPORT HIM ANYMORE!!!	1
Oh no, Ja Rule wanted to do a real street sound album, but he did a real pop sound album, again! Please, it's the best time to end your career. If you wanna make a great present for christmas for the people, stop your career!	1
You really have the impression somehow that she can't sing. Also the songs don't seem spectacular. It's weak dancey stuff - like DJ Bobo and all those acts. This is really a no-go for me	1
LAURYN SHOULD EITHER STICK TO HER OLD STYLE,RE UNITE WITH THE FUGEES OR JUST BABYSIT AT HOME.GIRL YOU'VE GOT TALENT BUT YOU ARE WASTING IT	1
STRAIGHT UP, THIS ALBUM SUCKS, THE LYRICS IS WACK AND SO IS THE BEATS. MYSTICAL NEXT TIME DO BETER.	1
It really is a pathetic tribute to a increadible artist.  Tupac deserves more than this half job, weak tribute.  I'm a huge 2Pac fan, and I'm telling you personaly, don't buy this CD.  This isn't a 2Pac CD, and it shouldn't be called one, becuase he would never make such a horrible CD.	1
Ice Cube is a Rap Legend Period.but his recordings after 92 have just gotten worse&amp;worse.I'm tired of Hearing Cube just getting by with 2nd Rate Tracks.you get a song hear&amp;their that sounds Familiar to his Peak  but other than that it's Melted ICE.He Lost his edge.	1
It is pop. Ja Rule is an embarassment to all MCs and should introduce his peanut head to a bullet. and please stop the tupac comparisons - ja doesn't have half the talent tupac did	1
Yo son! jus admit that jigga lost to Nas. Takeover wasn't betta than Nas's Ether. Nas is more talented than Jigga n made him look like his b#tch. Nas is tha best n jigga is jus a comercial rappa.	1
HORRIBLE FROM START TILL FINSIHTHEIR ARE ONLY 3 SONGS I LIKEOTHER THAN THAT THIS ALBUM SHOULD'VEBEEN SHELVED.	1
why?  another album by Juel is as necessary as spending time writing this review.  GOTTA GO!!!	1
If you have tha bad luck of owning this CD by VAN HALEN, there's still time to sell it... THis is the worst VAN HALEN album in the DAvid Lee Roth era, simple as that. Only two good songs here: LITTLE GUITARS and SECRETS. The rest is discardable.	1
what greatest hits? upset stomach variety? he can't sing.i wish he would stop trying to tarnish R-N-B music.doing dock of the bay? you have to be kidding? Bolton is a okay writer.but that straining gives me a  headache.that's not Soul that's toneless for a whole Decade.	1
If I was you Id click on Dr Dre and get both the Chronic albums instead.other albums that are betterMakaveli-the Don KiluminatiSnoop Doggy Dogg-DoggystyleNWA-Straight outta ComptonTha Dogg Poung-Dogg FoodIce Cube- Death CertificateNotorious BIG- Ready to DieListen to those and then compare if fiddy is a lyricists.	1
How do the folks at Interscope sleep at night?	1
Really only half a star...Michelle Branch pilescliche on top of cliche in this featherweight debut.I didn't think it was possible to create a sound thatsounded like watered-down Jewel (since Jewel iswatered-down Melissa Etheridge (Who's watered downBruce Springsteen)) but she's done it. Keep your money.	1
I dug His Anger about The Problems Facing Brothers&amp;All but the Music was Super Wack.and the only Gem is Brenda's Got A Baby.He Would Get Better with the Music&amp;the Words.but this Album Compared To Ice Cube's  Amerikkka's Most Wanted is Tame.he was going for the same vibe&amp;results  but he comes up empty except for Brenda's.	1
This new Ja Rule album is awful.  He gets progressively worse with each effort-somebody PLEASE stop the madness.	1
as Much as I Respect the Old Elton John the Mid-80's to Now John is pretty run of the mill.and this disc is a Snooze fest of the first order.the Material is really flat.very boring stuff.	1
This album has to be one of the worst recordings of a time. Puffy used to be rap, but ever since '98, he has been 100% pop. If you want to pick up some real east coast rap, then check out &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; by Jay-Z.	1
man she would have come off better putting out a best of mariah cd then putting out techno remixes of her best tunes this is sorry and further proof that mariah's career is washed up, c ya mariah been nice knowing you.	1
Timbaland ruins this album beatwise. The beats are just weak and Ginuwine's whiny voice just doesn't complement it. There are no standout songs and the album just wanders aimlessly from track to track. No  coherence.	1
You know, all of these songs really are stupid. Like &quot;Hot Dog&quot; and &quot;Boiler&quot; obviously just put on this CD to attract attention to 50 f words and suicide. I mean really..its sad, because Limp Bizkit wasnt always this bad. Theyw ere never great, but this is the CD thats going to wreck their career. Sorry guys, you suck.	1
As the title states, this album began the crapiness of 50 and the gay-unit.I only listened to the album because of the Ja diss.In the end, the album's stupid, g-unit's stupid, the fan's are stupid, their label's stupid, that stupid cracker Jimmy Iovine should die, and XXL magazine is stupid.	1
i like the first two alright and parts of the third one but this sounds tired and predictable.it sounds rushed and uninspired.i love good 70's sounding music when i hear it.the stevie wonder meets roy ayers thing was  cool but it's become stamped and that's not original.thus far they have put  out better singles than discs for me.	1
I've heard Big Pun as a guest artist on a few cuts and have liked those cuts very much but I was extermely disappointed with Capital Punishment.  All I can say is that it's standard fare from today's group of  rappers.Hopefully his future efforts will be more musically engaging.	1
I've got to give juvy credit, one mans trash is anothers treasure. He made this junk, (...)If these youngsters are what I have to look forward too in rap I think I'll change to country and western. (...)	1
I love the song Such great heights, but the rest of the album sounds like a cartoon or tetris is being played. It's gets stupid and the lyrics aren't good.	1
In this pathetic excuse of a cd and this band is nothing more than a public enemy/RATM (Which I Don't like either except their first album), Rip-Off without the honest truth of the worldIf this band is against america, then play someplace elseDull and uninspired.Nu Metal is Garbage	1
...........and rap has been mucked up for years.YOUNG MC,HURRY UP WITH THAT COMEBACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
All I can say is garbage. This CD is only taking up a slot in my cd holder. I've tried to listen to this cd several times and I've come to the conclusion that this is just Garbage. Good thing she has the hype, to help sell her records.	1
i didn't get Ephraim Lewis then or now.he was to me a 3rd tier Terence trent D'arby clone or a 2nd tier Seal.the words&amp;Music have been done all before by better talent.	1
Yall get it right.....someone told him this was worth releasing someone told him this ish was hot. Why has this happened ?Lord I need answers. I can't recommend buying this because I'll be in hell burning for lying.	1
Altoough the musicians involved in this album are all great British accomplished guys (Sykes, Murray and Dunbar), it's a shame to hear COverdale,one of the most authentic rock voices of all time, turn into  Californian mainstream glam metal. Sad..  Anyway, there are great pices of  musical hability.	1
Ruben could have done better on this album.This album is awful.None of the songs on there seem to fit his style.I rate this albmu 1 star.	1
That is exactally what every album by this no talent hack sounds like but ISure iron mike could write better lyrics.	1
Dis could'na been da real cd dey recorded back in da day when it wuz posed ta drop. Dis $hit sound boogie. Da beat be hard as hell den Fresh do sum stankin @$$ drop and da $hit jus fall to pieces. BOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Despite the constant screams and attempts to be loud, I found myself falling asleep listening to this last year. Enough said.	1
if it aint pac then it's outkast cash money or somebody else. these fools teeth should hurt with all the biting they do.	1
Come on dmx I mean Pac I mean Rule...	1
Because suckers by it, quickly get bored by it, then try to sell it.Except there are more suckers than buyers.Gangsta indeed. Only an idiot thinks gangsta's are good at making music.OK the dumbos who disagree can now press the "not helpful" button, and the smart people can, at least, consider what I've written.	1
For the inordinately curious.The Grant Green album is far superior to the Donald Byrd session, which isn't saying a whole lot.	1
All these mixes and remixes are bad ... there's nothing like the original versions if you know them. One of my favourite ones was Lil' Homies but here, this track has been spoiled totally. Nevertheless, Tupac remains and will always remain the best rapper till the end of times ...	1
Jay-z resonable doubt can't be compared 2 nas's illmatic. Illmatic is better than resonable doubt. Jay-z is a fake a** thug n a comercial rappa.	1
They are practically giving away record deals because she can't sing or dance. I wouldn't miss her if she left the game. BEEEOTCH!!!	1
liked her better before she discovered the wonderful world of hip hop.	1
Maybe Lauryn shouldve worried more about how bad her voice sounds than playing guitar at the level of an 8 year old.	1
To that person who called this 'the best CD of 2003', go buy 'Dance of Death' by Iron Maiden and tell me what's the best album of 2003!!! As for this album, it sucks. Listen to Iron Maiden, they kick ass!	1
Look, this CD just ain't worth it. I'm gonna put mine on sale soon in the &quot;used&quot; section, get it, it's almost brand new, I only played it once.	1
THIS GUY TO ME WENT FROM MAYBE ONE OF THE HOTTEST RAPPERS TODAY TO THE WORST. HE'S A RAPPER NOT A POP STAR. THIS IS LIKE A RAP/POP ALBUM. I DON'T LIKE IT.	1
RAIN DAYZ IS MY ONLY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ALBUM OTHER THEN THAT ITS GARBAGE	1
it is great that he found himself back on &quot;sacred love&quot;.here he is unsure what to play...Pop?dance?jazz??soul?rock?you can surely pass this album by...even the best song from here (&quot;after the rain has fallen&quot;) is not that good to buy whole album.go and get SACRED LOVE!	1
...have fun in prison you creep. I hope bubba gives you a Christmas gift all year around,while you're in the shower with him. Enjoy your time in the big house,ya murdering little goon.	1
Wings specialty was the blandly innocuous; the band was basically the Huey Lewis of the seventies, but without the sense of dumb fun. On this album, McCartney makes some stabs at Hard Rock, this makes it worse than the average Wings album, is it the worst one ever? Perhaps, then again, who cares?	1
Yeeches!  Yet ANOTHER compilation to MILK the fans! I love this group, and they deserve better. and if they can't put out sometime NEW,or not on Cd yet, then So be it...but keep releasing the SAME songs! (oh, I am sorry  there is ONE new Track to cd on this compilation...THANKS!	1
GOooooshh,.... and to think that Fast Eddie Clarke once was the guitarrist of mighty MOTORHEAD.... And one still wonders why they &quot;did not became huge&quot;... Almost all metal artists that sold out to make commercial pop metal failed in obtaining any amjor gains. FASTWAY, led by Fast Eddie Clarke, is another of these cases.	1
I don't like this album or Emo. weezer and Emo are for suburban squares whose favorite movie is Ferris Bueller's day off and favorite book is catcher in the rye. These guys should of quit 8 years ago.	1
When Eminem dropped the slim shady LP I thoguht he was pretty good but then he dropped Marshall Matters which was wore and now this:PURE POP MUSIC FOR WHITE PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED TO BUY BLACK RAPPERS ALBUMS...DON'T BELIEV THE HYPE, EMINEM IS REALLY CORNY! Buy TUPAC instead	1
JAY-Z IS A PHONY.HE COPIES MAKAVELI IN MUSIC VIDEOS ,QUOTES,ECT.THE ON LY GOOD THING IN THIS ALBUM IS THE TRACK FEATURING DRE,THAT CUT IS ILL.	1
like so-many boy bands of today they all seem to sing without any kind of feeling and any texture.nothing stands out.it is all formula without substance.all-4-one are a 2nd tier Boyz 11 Men.overplayed songs with little  lasting impressions.also none of these bands except Hanson play or write  anything.they are a push button for a Producer.	1
Horrible album from a no-talent zero. Yeah I'm sure she'll be around for decades to come with this laughable effort. I'm Like A Tird is a horrid piece of pop and only appeals to brain dead Clear Channel listeners who think Justin Timberlake &amp; Pink are &quot;gods.&quot; Look for her sophmore effort to fail miserably in the upcoming weeks.	1
The White Stripes is one of the worst bands in rock n roll todayand this album is so dreadful it makes me sick, poor produced songs, stupid singing, and dreadful writingand their music video was horrible.Thank Goodness for AC/DC.At Least they are better.	1
The only song I like is &quot;Bout It, Bout It III&quot;. Don't waste your hard earned money or your parents money on this wack garbage.Peace On Earth.	1
This is the worst piece of crap ive ever heard. Avoid at all costs.	1
thank God that the whole rap-metal scene died down! "rap-metal" is no substitute for real metal. and that closet queen diva fred durst should go sing wit da Village People! i am docking one star just for Fred Durst being on this! the other 3 stars are subtracted because this crappy record is just a contrived record company caca scheme.	1
RZA is not a rapper and unfortunately he reminds us about that throughout this album...	1
If you claim to like hip hop, please by the following albums before you buy this one :1)  Illmatic 2)  Ready to Die 3)  36 Chambers 4)  Full Clip : A decade of gangstarrThese are what hip hop is all about.	1
"video killed..." sounds like the 15 year old tracy merop singing in the song	1
this CD Deserves 1/2 a Star Because i did enjoy whipping it out the window of my car into a nearby bicyclist....It was pretty funny.  Otherwise this record was worthless.	1
fred durst turned 40 yesterdayits funny becuase he makes music for all ageskids under 13 love fred , they look up to him as a fatheronly a genius could make music that appeals to young teens like me	1
Eminem is the soundtrack for &quot;The Future Losers of America&quot;.  All of his songs are negative and spiteful and meant to bring out the worst in humanity.  &quot;Stan&quot; contains lyrics that promote the killing of homosexuals (well at least that's the way I interpret &quot;stabbing a fag or a lez&quot; means).  Listen and deteroirate.	1
-I don't know.  I love GG, and many of their albums are perfect.But this one, I can't wrap my head around it.It's too simple, and a big step down from AQUIRING THE TASTE.Alot of people love it, so maybe it's me.But, IMHO there's only one good song here.  Not enough to make me spend my hard-earned money.-	1
I'm sick of these guys.  Where critics and the like get off that they have talent is beyond me.  Hey Ya is not a good song.  It's not even close to charting in my book.  I can't understand why it's even on Billboard's chart.  This CD would make a great coaster.	1
I don't know what these two 'musicians' were thinking when they put out this album.  It's horrible.  I am still wondering why I bought this in the first place.  If you want real rap, then check out N.W.A.  I can't stand to  listen to a single song of theirs.	1
This is the best album ever. You can tell it's some pretty heady, affected, quirky stuff because there's a copy of The Trial on the cover next to that girl who's feigning fashionable malaise. The Trial is a book written by a smart Russian guy called Franz Kefka. I love books.	1
I never understood what's the BIG deal behind this album. Yes, the production is wonderfull but the songwriting is childish and rubbish. Brial Wilson definitly can not write great lyrics like Bob Dylan sometimes do. "God Only Know" and "Wouldnt Be nice" are indeed masterpieces...but the rest of the album is background music..	1
this is the same music as &quot;50 cents&quot; albums, same music, same lyrics, same songs, its amazing people shell out money for the same thing, only thing that changes is the artists name...boyzzzz!	1
This is probably one of the worst cds in history.I'd rather listen to betoven than this.I feel contaminated to have ever even touched this cd.Ewww[...]TOP 5=cant even be five,only good song is the pledge remix.you start to hate memsmerize after you listen to it once.	1
led zeppelin was much much better! i don't like this album at all! this was a commecial album! no good songs!	1
I really want to give this CD a better rating because I like Mystikal, but I gotta be honest. This CD is terrible. The only great song is Danger. Everything else sounds the same. I recommend Unpredictable or Ghetto Fabulous because they are better than Let's Get Ready. Sorry Mystikal! But next time try harder!!	1
Can someone please tell me why people compare this to my favorite band Nivarna? Sometime's it's really fast like hardcore death metal like Slipknot and sometimes it's really slow like they got tired. what!!! make up your mind please. I guess it's funny when he's singing about goats but this isn't nearly as good as Nivarna.	1
Yo what up dog. I am just talking like them. Eminem thinks he is tough. I am really scared of a 5'10 150 pound boy  who couldn't survive one second in the army. Eminem is terrible so do everybody a favor and do not support his &quot;music.&quot; And he is a wifebeater. Why would you support a beater?	1
What a great collection of Jimmy's early songs.  There isn't a bad song on this album unlike his latest offering in 2013 which had nothing redeeming on it in my opinion.A must have for the serious music collection.  4 paws up from my cat Sammy and she knows her music.	2
If your an old hippie, this album is a classic and a must to have. I don't think I'll ever get tired of it.	2
Rocks is the magnum opus of 70's rock, period. It's a combination of functioning drug use and raw talent, it was magic while it lasted for a few years, eventually it caught up with them at the end of the decade.	2
Who needs superman when you have superwoman. A voice that packs a huge punch. A great album. Barbra's voice is timeless.	2
This is a magnificent album, that seems to get better with age. From start to finish, it ranks among the top 10 albums ever produced, no question.	2
This is one of my favorite CD's by Joe Sample.  The title track of the CD is awesome!  Heard it once in the background on the TV show &quot;General Hospital&quot; and I wanted to listen to the CD all over again.  Sample is a wonderful pianist and a great composer.  It's always a pleasure to listen.	2
This album helped me survive my high school years, and when I listen to it now, it brings back those sweet and painful years of being a sensitive teenager.	2
Phat, WestCoast Rap! Mack One Dim puts it down with my favorite and the best song on the record &quot;Foe Life&quot; Followed by &quot;Westside SlaughterHouse&quot; wit WC and Cube, dope cd I recommend it to all the  people who like West Coast gangsta rap.	2
I LOVE The Gap Band!Burn RubberYou Dropped a Bomb on MeParty Trainplus the slow jams...a great Greatest Hits album!	2
Early Mobb, but still an enjoyable listen. "Hit it from the back" classic song from hav & p. Overall its a A-	2
This is some excellent Stevie music for existing or new fans. He shows us his deep lyrics and beautiful melodies!. Stevie at his best! I highly recommend it!	2
Great Hall and Oates album,includes the now classic She's Gone in all it's 5 minutes plus glory,the radio seemed to play the 3 minute single edit,but the version on this album is much better,that's not the only great song,every tune on this classic album is top notch,a very recommended album!!!	2
an AWESOME CD! &quot;You're Still a Young Man&quot; is one of my favorite songs ever. &quot;Down to the Nightclub&quot; is such a great song. This CD is great.	2
I'm not one of the 2Pac mythologizers, but he was a gifted wordsmith and had a deft delivery. This anthology works better than many rap compilations because 2Pac's material stands up very well taken out of its original context. Nearly every track worth collecting has been gathered here, making it an ideal introduction or retrospective to a powerful artist.	2
The song listing is missing song #1 on the CD.  It is called "DON'T COME CRYIN' TO ME", and this is the only CD you can get it on.  I attempted to get the song list for this CD corrected thru Amazon, but there is no avenue to have this done.  Modern technology for you!!	2
Great production from the Bad Boy camp. You can tell this album was heavily influenced by Dr Dre's The Chronic album. You know you have a great album when the best songs aren't the hit singles. The centerpiece of the album is "Me & My Bitch"	2
Biggie made an album that influenced rap hugely. This here is timeless material, he will always live through his music. CLASSIC!	2
On this fantastic CD, Will Downing and Gerald Albright took romantic Soul to new heights. The combination of Will's velvet-smooth vocals and Albright's smooth and elegant sax playing makes for some heavenly romantic music that's guaranteed to put you in the mood for love and romance. "The Nearness of You", "Like A Lover" and the title track are true masterpieces.	2
My favorite R. Kelly CD to date--a note: trapped on track 8, is an overlooked, but great song called &quot;For You&quot; that I'm sure you will play over &amp; over--trust me.	2
I discovered Astrud Gilberto quite by accident when rummaging thru my sister's extensive jazz album collection...Really wanted to hear her defintive interpretations of 'Corcovado' (after being captivated by EBTG's brilliant drum 'n bass remake) and the seminal standard 'The Girl From Ipanema', and am really enjoying this album.	2
This is a wonderful bone album to have thoe I think btnh Resurrection is alot better the tightest songs are 1,2,4,6,7,8,10,12,13,16,17 classic songs are 3,4,5,9,15 all right songs are ,11. "may God bless you and keep you"	2
I listened to this Cd on the way in to work this morning, and I must tell you it is a great CD.  Full of Jazz and rockish jazz... my favorite story teller song is SOMETHING THE BOY SAID.... very good story and full of anticipation.  If you like sting, u will like this, perhaps a lot.	2
Pretty good	2
Tower of Power is Something else.those Horns don't Front.back in the day  to be considered a Power House you had to be able to pull off many  different Musical Styles.Well TOP didn't have that Problem.they Played  Everything&amp;then some.this Set is Slamming.they have Influenced alot of  Groups&amp;Artists.Oakland Stroke Ain't NO Joke.	2
I didn't like this at first, but now I find it great! It's really lighthearted and happy, foreign to what we're used to seeing on tv and radio. It has harder rock too. It's a surreal soundscape, a wonderful escape.	2
Mellencamp is as good as ever on this album, the first for Columbia. This is rock at it's best, and no one does rock better than Mellencamp. This album also generated some of Mellencamp's best reviews in years, and they are well earned. This is an album that all rock fans should own.	2
a masterpiece that revolutionized black music. It's rich with grooves to it's boundless sense of possibilities. What's Going On is the Sgt. Pepper of soul.	2
One of the best from Elton John.  Has both of his best hit singles as well: "Honky Cat" and "Rocket Man"	2
I have worn through a few cassette tapes AND a few CDs of this. Amazing music.You will stay in your car on a hot Summer day to listen to this.  Secret Garden.  Great music for lovers old and young.	2
This album and Pieces of You are my favorite albums ever! Jewel touches you so deeply that you want to listen to them over and over. I have never fell so much in love with anyone's music as I have Jewel! This is a must to  your CD collection!	2
I love Tamia,but her version of ''You Put A Move on My Heart'' could never touch Mica's version.Mica made you feel what she was saying in a way Tamia never could.	2
This album is so ridiculous, I personally think it maybe their best album. 'Supersonic', 'Falling', 'Black Capircorn Day' it all is just perfect. The whole tempo of the album is nasty, funky and bad ass. Jay Kay is just the man.	2
Most of the essential Wings' hits are here.  It's been said many times, I'll restate it:  &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; is among Paul's best songs  and this is the easiest way to get it on CD.  If you want to purchase only  one Wings' album, get this.	2
Roger&amp;Zapp Rock&amp;FUnk all through this Disc.The Jams&amp;Grooves Never Let Up.The Music Smokes Non-Stop.The Genius Of Roger is on full display here.More Bounce to the Ounce still Makes Heads Bop.Be Alright is a  Great Slow-Jam.Very Essential.	2
this album is 100 percent classic it has three of the greatest rap songs of all time i wanna kill sam my summer vacation and steady mobbin and includes one of the greatest disses of all time no vaseline dissing eazy-e and nwa this album is classic, so pick it up	2
the guys that started it all.this is what i call real hip hop with a little of funk.it has the 15 minute song,&quot;rappers delight&quot;,&quot;showdown&quot;,and &quot;apache&quot; just to name a  few.hip hop has changed for the worst now.it was better with the pioneers  of hip hop like the sugar hill gang.	2
Miss White is a cross between Whitney and Jody Watley with a bit more r&b involved. The female Bobby Brown. Funky dance with good love songs. Good artist.	2
Beautifully remastered SACD of a great recording. This blows away the redbook version on all fronts. It's great to see this format still alive and kicking.	2
Hello...This cd is absolutely brilliant... My fave track is &quot;Teardrop&quot; with &quot;Intertia Creeps&quot; right behind it... I bought it immediately after I heard a dj friend spin &quot;Teardrop&quot; to close out a barefoot dance I attend on occasion... Not one cent was wasted - every track is worth it's weight in chocolate...	2
Great singer with great amount of Soul. I loved her voice when I first heard it in the 90's and still love it! This is some GREAT music! All of her hits.. This is the right time, Been around the world, etc! Great for any collection!	2
This is my first cd that I have bought of Biggie's and I must say that it is an amazing piece of work. Every track is bouncing, but I was especially moved by his mom's outro. I must also agree that Puff used way too many  guest artist, and this alone took away from Biggie's last time to shine.	2
I love what you wanna do featuring the whole rhyme syndicate that was tight back in 89 and also features lethal weapon and you played yourself ice t was a real brother and told it like it was on every cd long live the Iceberg.	2
THE MAN!!!!!  hell, to me, he died too soon.  this collection right here is ESSENTIAL!!!!  nuff said, it's DA GODFATHA NOW!!!!!  rest in peace, soul brotha!!!!	2
They play loud, so turn it up loud. These guys can rock it. These guys can roll it. DEEP PURPLE.....support your favorite artists.	2
The irreverent, multi-talented musician reinvents herself yet again with this fabulous collection of sound. Lady Madonna doesn't get older - she just gets better!	2
This CD is a nice sampling of ZZ Tops music!!! Contains the classic tracks:Sharp Dressed Man,La Grange,Tube Snake Boogie,Cheap Sunglasses,Tush,Gimmie All Your Lovin,I'm Bad,I'm Nationwide and many more!!! A great single CD of ZZ Top's best tunes!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+	2
And ya don't quit! This is an essential listen. Warren G's smooth raps and G Funk rhythums will never be duplicated but often imitated. Warren G is original and that's why this LP get 5 stars!!!	2
jb was dynamite you want funk live uncut raw from the godfather and his disciples get this.	2
I was struck dumb when I first heard this.  I was listening tothis and Allan Toussaint's Southern Nights roughly together.  Between the grooves and the production, this is one timeless recording.	2
This is the one where he bares his soul, reaches for eternity, attains it.	2
This album is timeless as I just played it again for the first time in about 7 years.  The beats are solid and it is well produced.  Very strong debut album from an old school west coast player.  Warren's voice is very soothing and a good delivery style.  This album has stood the test of time.	2
Eclectic and slow, but funky and fun.Definately buy this if you like Pink Floyd - Piper at the Gates of Dawn	2
What an amazing album, may very easily be the best of the Steely Dan catalogue	2
Parliament did more with less than fifty minutes than most of today's current crop of stars with their overproduced, vocally enhanced, overstuffed-at-70-minutes releases.&quot;Bop Gun&quot; and &quot;Flashlight&quot; are TRUE classics.	2
robert johnson is simply a cornerstone of american music. buy it, breathe it in through the ears and feel america pushing up at the soles of your feet. then have a beer. you can call that a good evening, yes sir.	2
One of the most melodic and appealing of jazz albums. Getz, Joao Gilberto, and Astrud Gilberto make for a formidable and winning team. Pure pleasure.	2
I chose this rating because..well..it's a classic!The artwork,the circumstance behind the making of it, and the MUSIC!If you even like music..this shoulod be in your collection. Period.	2
SILK DEGREES is Boz Scaggs' best album ever, and it just got even better, with extra songs and a deluxe remastering treatment that's warm and close, not harsh and shrill. There are many great songs here, especially "Lowdown and the full-tilt R&B-rocker "Lido Shuffle." If you have the old version, get rid of it after buying this CD.	2
There is one gripe:  YOU'RE MY FIRST, MY LAST, MY EVERYTHING does not have the introduction with the words spoken by Barry which was on the original CAN'T GET ENOUGH album.  I think sometimes his introductions are almost comical.But other than that...a perfect collection!	2
If there was any disco artist who did not get their due, it was Candi Staton. Young Hearts Run Free is a classic disco jam along with When you wake up tomorrow. Victim is the overall favorite of mine.	2
Great CD.  The words and music are heartfelt and important."Vincent" perhaps the strongest song in this collection.	2
THIS IS THE MOST FULLY HEATED 2CD ALBUM I KNOW OF-YUKMOUTH TEARS $HIT UP SPITTIN LIKE AN AK & DROPPIN CLEAN BEATS THAN SLAM W/THAT MOB THUNDER-PEEP ALL HIS  & THE LUNIZ ALBUMZ	2
If you don't get this one, you're missing the best from one of the greatest pop groups of all time. It's pop, but pop that doesn't follow any rigid rules. And the lead singer has a beautiful voice.	2
Every single song on the album is great, and that is an accomplishment in itself. But just look at what is on this CD: &quot;the hurting&quot; , &quot;pale shelter&quot;, &quot;memories fade&quot; are just a few of classic tunes. A great buy!	2
this collective set comes with 2 CD.  some of the songs in this set are band on the run, bluebird, no words let me roll it plus more.  the sound is great what you would expect.	2
This collection sums up the total career of this dynamic duo.  If you love this collection then you should also get the albums where the greatest hits came from.	2
This is one of my more favorite cds that came out after his death. it`s great and as the rest of them to follow as well.	2
This album has the best Lips sound. The classic sound. Squelchy guitars, backwords strings, and just general all around weirdness that forms a melody. In my opinion, their best album, by far. This album and Mercury  Rev's &quot;Yerself is Steem&quot; are 2 early 90s must haves. Very  similiar sounding.	2
Into the fire is one of the best albums from bryan after reckless album.this cd features hits like heat of the night victim of love native son.this album is really very good  and is very highly recommended.	2
i cant get enough of this CD. all the songs are STR8. this CD is a musy buy.	2
It just boggles my mind that Fiona was my age when she made this album, yet the material is so incredibly complex, full of jazz chords and rhythms, and wonderful lyrics. I admire her a great deal and wish that I was as  gifted a songwriter as she.	2
The lyrics might be explicit, but they are great! And oh so clever! Sublime was one of few bands that could carry an authentic reggae beat. If you're a fun person, get this. and if you're not, get it anyway!!	2
Great cd!  Great band!  Start with this one if your just getting into them....great from start to finish	2
Charlie Brown & Busta were the stars of LONS. My beef is Charlie could have been as big as Busta. I'm not sure what happened but C Brown was a star.Top JointsZone CoasterZeekersCase of the PTATransformerSobb Story	2
Excellent album from the KING.  Promise Land is a great collection of songs and a very strong album in the legacy of Elvis Presley.	2
The Emotions, like the Supremes of the 60's and the 40's Andrews Sisters, remains one of the best female singing trios ever.  This set of their greatest (classics like &quot;Best of My Love,&quot; &quot;Boogie Wonderland,&quot; &quot;Don't Ask My Neighbors,&quot; and &quot;Rejoice&quot;) superbly illustrates that fact.Destiny's Child, eat your heart out!	2
epmd is definately a legendary act, and always worth the price of admission. this album is a must have, no question. when you listen to it (the double) and hear all samples that other rappers have used since,  you'll know why they're pioneers and why this disc (the double) is  invaluable. peace.	2
The Skull cd lets you bounce to the cool beats.  The Bones cd rocks your ear drums w/ slamming guitar chords!  Great idea to blend rap &amp; heavy metal!  Reminds me of the Judgement Night soundtrack.	2
I've been wanting this record for a while now so I can add this album to my 2pac collection. Te whole albums is nice. The way the beats play, the sample music 2pac added with different artists. The way 2pac says on this record. I recommend to buy this album! You'll enjoy it!	2
The whole CD is great.  Reminds me of good friends when we use to listen to this music when it was popular.	2
This really does highlight how talented this artist is. Listening to the material live brings out a depth to it that you don't really get from the slickly produced studio versions. Plus there's a great, and surprisingly faithful, version of an Earth Wind &amp; Fire tune, which i love.	2
Freedy Johnston / This Perfect World:  This singer-songwriter is great at both.  Touching and catchy, this album gets Five Stars.	2
A great album by the godfather of soul..&#34;do the best i can&#34; is also one of my favorites..along with &#34;the payback&#34; and &#34;stone to the bone&#34;	2
I remember when this came out in the late 70's, I was a senior in high school.  Brings back a lot of memories.  Lots of good material on this.	2
Despite the missing McCartney great &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; (not yet recorded), this is the quintessential Paul McCartney album. Forget other Paul McCartney albums, his genius is consolidated in this one album, dismissing any idea of what many call his post-Beatles &quot;garbage&quot; career. All you need is Wings Greatest, Wings Greatest is all you need.	2
What can I say about this album that hasn`t been already said. This was a gift from old Spigatee One. This is just great west coast classic gangsta goodness.	2
I'll take this album over PROTECTION any day as the latter sounds almost boring in comparison. Flying tablas, breathing atmospheres, 2-ton beats . . . put this on and just groooove, baby! It's a trip.	2
this is the good stuff from the 80's.  this is my second CD from the cars.  on this CD this has the songs i refuse, drive, looking for love and other classics.	2
This is a classic Whitney music when we still had her. This is some great music when she could sing! I highly recommend it!	2
this is what live rock music is all about.the who in thier prime just crushing it song after song after song	2
Please see producer Mark Linett's review under the deluxe "fuzzy" version of this new CD/DVD. The mono version of the album has been remastered from a superior source to that used in 2000, and a more complete version of "Hang On To Your Ego" has been used.	2
Excellent job on the remix/remastering. Sounds incredible. The detail and fidelity are exceptional. The same goes for Electric Ladyland. High quality dead silent vinyl.	2
This has to be Jay-Z's best album so far.  If you liked Vol. 2, Hard Knock Life, then I think that you will really like this album.  When I bought it the songs that I really liked were: 1-4, 7-13, and 15.  This is a really  great album that I think you should purchase.	2
Chronic 2001 is one of the best rap CD's ever. The best songs are [Blank] You, Big Ego's, Light speed, Let's Get High, and Housewife.BUY IT!!!!!!!!!	2
Hello...Madonna got it erotica music right with this cd...My fave 2 tracks are &quot;Erotica&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot;... Both different but very good...  I also absolutely love &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; and &quot;Bad Girl&quot; is a fun song.  &quot;Rain&quot; is a beautiful melancholic song that chills me out...Again, if you're a Madonna fan you'll love it......peace...	2
Great CD.  I love the overall sound.  and the little man....mandolin....is GREAT.  I thought it was a GREAT change from the first CD, rather than just being PART II.I LOVE THIS CD.Incredible.	2
one of their best albums. is great and rocks brilliantly with out stop or even slowing down once or twice.	2
Songs 1. Already gone 2. You never cry like a lover 3. Midnight flyer 4. My man 5. On the border 6. James dean 7. Ol 55 8. Is it true 9. Good day in hell 10. The best of my love	2
This is a nice little compiation of Strawberry Alarm Clock tunes!!! A bit short at just 10 tracks but it does the job!!! That immortal song(Incence and Peppermints,it's also the name of this compilation!!!) is here of course,along with Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow,Tomorrow and 7 more S.A.C. classics!!! Nice sound quality too!!! Groovy Baby!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way up!!! A+	2
DMX has the fiercest flow I have ever heard from a rap artist. His growls, barks and snarling make him seem really angry and forceful throughout the album creating one hell of a great sound. His subject matter is deep and his poetic style complete this album perfectly. Well Done.	2
