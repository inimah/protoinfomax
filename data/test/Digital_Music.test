this album is not interesting, brings nothing new to the rap world, has mentally retarded lyrics most of which are not thuggish or gangsterish but plain stupid. if you are looking for real thug music, check out project pat. this is absolute trash	1
There is not a single bearable song on this album.  No good guitar, no good synth, no melodies, Brandon's voice breaks unbearabley, no dramatic high places, etc.  I loved the first two albums, but after this piece of garbage and the horribly-distorted concert performance I saw of them last summer, Mr. Flowers & Company are done.	1
This music sucks so bad it would make feces smell good.  Green Day suck and this song is possibly one of the worst, most annoying songs I've had the displeasure of hearing.  Die Green Day.	1
1 1/2Aside from few fleeting moments of engaging experimentation, the group's sketchy framework exposes a decayed underbelly of creative drought.	1
There really isnt anything here worth buying. The song is pretty much just a boring waste of time. It isnt the worst song ever, but the music is pretty lame, the vocals uninspired, the lyrics repetitive and passe. Nothing here i would go out of my way to listen to, and would definitely never pay money for it.	1
This is not old school, It is for the young and energy driven. Good dance music not just for listening.	1
This is good listening music for the young; dancing too I guess. Too young for me but I still recommend it.	1
I'm sure this will sell millions of CDs but that still doesn't make it good. I'm sure radio will play it into the ground while other, more talented artists are ignored.What a shame.	1
yea good job BET, this is great for declining the culture of hip hop with suger coated, commercial wack music like this...way to go keep doing you thing, cant believe guys actually like this garbage, these days, even the hardest cats on the streets are turning soft with corny music like this...same goes for Pretty Ricky and Bow Wow	1
I used to be the hugest fan of 50. Get Rich or Die Tryin was nothing below awesome. To tell the truth, i am completely off rap now. i dont know why he went down the path of such a bad 2nd coming.I'll to take 50 to the brain shopSomething made his head go pop	1
I cringed when I saw the 5 star reviews for this abomination of a song. Do you people see how braindead the public are? They just listen to the "popular" stuff no matter if it sucks or not, and well, this just plain sucks. The American mainstream media never stops. Music is dying, and this is why.	1
once again brit is making a whore out of herself talking in those devil like codes we know rock stars love using those codes and swear the public knows nothing about it anyway more techno crap about how brit talking about all the boya and gals wanna screw her.	1
Another poppish album, containing lyrics and beats geared towards females and club going metrosexuals.Only a couple of good tracks, if you've heard their earlier material, then you know which songs I'm talking about.MTV queers will dig this, however fans of their earlier Horror-core style will only find themselves pressing the skip button often.	1
This is by far the most pathetic reunion album in the last 10 years.  Pure Garbage from the fathers of gay goth, emo gayrock.	1
I liked Joss better when he was doing Buffy & Angel, not tired pop songs.	1
The Red Headed stranger he ain't no more.  All the songs here all sound like on long...long...long...uninspired, tedious song, even his classic "Always on my mind" is butchered.  Give it up Willie.	1
D4L and DFB are hopefully never coming back. The wierd thing is that the only kids i've heard listening to this are the rich, suburban white kids that live down the street from me. They turn this up in thier cars and call it real rap. THis is not real rap.	1
this song cusses too much so it is not a good song i will not be listening to this song anymore	1
in the 80s magic was the word beatles had shown the way moody blues&co kept on with talent now everybody is trying to be wellknown&recognised by its violence &stupidity no matter the colour hes white&worst of the team	1
The whining in this song makes me crazy. It sounds like Coldplay's Chris Martin getting raped in a maximum security prison shower. A-awe-awe-all! terrible!	1
I don't see how anyone could truly like this...even if the musicians had some form of talent it wouldn't matter because the singer is horrible and couldn't sing in key if his life depended on it.  Worst cd I've bought in awhile.  Stray clear.	1
what are you talking about. Nas and Jadakiss will murder this clown. Nas probally has more money then 50 Cents because 50 probally flushed it down the tank. I am sorry for doing this DI but this review by you was kind of nuts. How about like me you review the other CD off the album and not the biacies.	1
wow after listening to this album i was like wow this is amazing I've never heard this before,then that baby boomer from Modest Mouse came into my room and was like &quot;uhhhh(sarcastic uh) yes you have.&quot;	1
I stupidly only listened to the sample of this song before purchasing it.  It is boring, repetitious and I immediately deleted it from my devices and cloud.  A complete waste of money.	1
I dont really listen to that much Rock music,but this CD is depressing as hell.Its not good music.I mean minutes to midnight is way better than this album.	1
This is a great album it Is 50 Cent's BEST. It has alot of hits like 21 Questions, In Da Club, and WANKSTA. This whole album is great.	2
add to your collection of cole's recordinmg. She can do no wrong and you should purchase it and give as gifts	2
It has a catching tune and the lyrics are about relationships that are meant to be in love. .Hope that this song will bring two people together in their heart's. .	2
Eminem is a genius. I love all his CDs. He is so funny, plus how does he think of these things? Genius, I tell you! Great CD.	2
This was very good , love her voice in this song it was also very clear and easy listening. Gave it a 5 star rating it was real good and would highly recommend!	2
I love her voice! Love every song!  She is new, with an old soul. This young lady sounds Great! Buy this CD, you will love it!	2
I love all that Trae put out, but have to say this is one of his best yet. If you love this you will love Devin the Dude's new title Smoke Sessions Vol. 1	2
I'll make it short and to the point....when you have hip hop luminaries like Dre, Andre 3000, Big Boi, Game and others backing you...how can you go wrong? If you're a true hip hop fan-get this album!	2
This album is spectacular. Some of the songs are just so powerful, like "I Can't See New York" and "Carbon" (which the constant piano rhythm reminds me of "Siren"). Other songs are just so beautiful, like "Strange", "Your Cloud", and "Gold Dust". Others rock, like "Don't Make Me Come to Vegas" and "Sweet Sangria". The whole album is another masterpiece.	2
these guys are great together but they can pull it off by themsleves to this double cd is priced great and you get two sounds for the price of one I like Big Boi's cd the most overall but Hey Ya is a greta song and Andrei 3000 is my favorite member of the group	2
Love this song.  It is so relaxing. Would make great dinner music for a Christmas party or great for just chilling	2
Have wanted this album for ages, and it does not disappoint.  It does sound like music from the 80s, but hey what is wrong with that.  Have only just got it, listened to it and just love it, can't wait for the next album from Ladyhawke.	2
I'm not a big fan of Folk music, which is what this is classified as, I guess?The lyrics are so fair and true, simple yet profound.  I listened to this over and over recently while working on something and it was like mental Yoga.Fantastic!	2
The Deluxe Edition has 4 BONUS SONGS (So Gone, We Loved It (f. Seal), Aim High, For The First Time).  Takes Love in the Future to that next level especially We Loved It where Seal just kills it!	2
Dashboard is awesome and If you liked showoff check out chris from showoffs new band Farewell My Enemy at [...] they are really f'n awesome.Tom	2
That's what this is. A fresh look at a musical icon. Great "all around" performance, package, title ok, recording, etc... Worth the time to listen and enjoy. Down to earth. Whoever came up with this has done Jimi well. I am happy to have listened and enjoyed it....	2
he's got a blunderbuss that will smash your holiday pumpkins and toss your rag doll out in the street!! how cool.	2
this is an awesome cd by these guys as always hard heavy riffs thick drums and awesome lyrics. buy this now	2
...simply beautiful.  Her voice, the lyrics, the melodies, the instrumentation, everything.  Excellent use of strings.  It's not a happy album, though.  I'm OK with that, but I wonder if Sheryl knew, subconsciously, that her union with Lance was doomed.	2
This is a fun, upbeat album that has just the right amount of catch to it. I had heard a couple of the tracks before on the radio unknowingly, and happened to always like them, so this was a nice surprise. IMO, the evolution from the first Broken Bells album is definitely a positive one.	2
this is one of my favorite songs and I love it. I would recommend this to everyone and I listen to it all the time.	2
I actually bought the past two albums and this band keeps growing and getting better. For some reason I could care less about seeing them in concert. That being said their past two albums and this album are excellent.	2
I wanted lots of Christmas songs to brighten our ride to the in-laws and beyond. Though I dint use them much this year. But this is a great copy.	2
We need more acts like floetry in the music biz for those tired of the usual mtv-bet bullcrap we see everytime dj jazzy jeff is shedding some light to the bling bling disease with these 2 talented girls along with jill scott, and musiq I would get this definetly.	2
This is such a catchy song.  My family loves to listen to it.  It would be great to play at a party, even a wedding reception.  I really like Carl Rae Jepsen's vocals.  Buy this song and have fun with it!!	2
The skates are sturdy and well-made, supports ankles, nice color for little girls. Some smaller children might need parental help with balancing at first.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
You cannot go wrong with Legos. Now if I could just get my child to pick them up so the dog doesn't eat them.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
trust worthy company.  they make great toys consistently.  I buy tons of lego city toys for my son and will continue to buy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I read reviews for other placemats, some were too thick, not grippy enough or too sticky..... This one is perfect. It's easy to clean, not too thick or flimsy. it can even get rolled up and travel in a diaper bag.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son wanted this so I got it as part of a xmas gift. He has been using it since he got it and it still works perfectly. This is exactly what he wanted and the generic works just like it is supposed to! I would recommend this product based on it's performance and excellent price!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This toy is so wonderful and every baby should have one. My 14-month-old still loves hers, still chews on it. It's her favorite!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love the vita It has a camera to see your self or some one else it downloads movies or plays videos and games.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought this for my 4 year old daughter as kind of a pre sewing activity. I enjoy it too. We have only played with it once, but it will be a keeper. It comes in a travel case too.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
As grandparents with visiting little ones this was perfect. The sound clarity was excellent. We could all enjoy our time during baby's nap without worry.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My soon to be four year old son is obsessed with all things batman. He asked for a robin and we found this. It is a great toy and the perfect size.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Her name says it all.  Her cape is awesome and colorful.  Her goggles are extreme.  I think this will be my doll.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Soft bristles, rounded balls protect the comb teeth so they don't scratch baby's delicate scalp, it is the perfect sized set for their first brush and comb. My only gripe is that you cannot choose the color, and they sent me blue for my little girl. Oh well, not really a big deal.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Pillow pet is great. large, soft and comfy without any complaints. if you buy with a matching dream lite, I am sure that would be real surprise treat for your kids	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this boom box, has great sound and the radio works so clear,it works better then the one I havemy granddaughter loves itgreat sound , easy to use and really nice	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Game works perfectly, activated it through Steam.Took a few minutes to activate but not worth knocking a star off, plays fine on my computer 49-60 fps.Paid $7.49 total for this bundle. LOVE IT! Thanks Amazon! Definitely worth the money.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great seat, straps easily to any chair and there are no nooks or crannies for muck to get into.  So easy to clean and the little toys on top really buy some time when I'm trying to get dinner ready AND keep her entertained.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I really like the idea of these spoons; however, they are clearly meant for right-handed children. Frankly, I'm surprised that Sassy doesn't make a version for lefties. Apart from the design flaw, the spoons are well constructed and cute.  If your child is right-handed, I would definitely recommend giving these a try, if not, don't bother.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
INCREDIBLE. This game is simply the best racing game i have ever played in my life, after playing Forza 2,3,4, & Horizon, as well as Gran Turismo 3,4,5. I would recommend this game to anyone that loves cars, or just that loves to drive fast!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Loved this game growing up, playing it with my young children (now adults) and continue enjoying playing this game with family and friends.  This is an excellent game for all ages even those who do not games!  Definitely a keeper!!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My son can not stop playing with this plush. He has a blast playing Mario and Sonic games on the Wii. Awesome!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
