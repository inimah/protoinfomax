I'm sorry, but they RUINED battle mode in this game....period.Grand Prix is OK, but nothing special...thus, I feel this is the weakest console based MK in the entire series. I hate it, but it's true. Very disappointed. I rank the MKs as such: 1. Super Mario Kart 2. Double Dash 3. Wii 4. MK64 5. MK8	1
90s graphics, stupid storyline, bad controls and gun play, bought it used and that is all it is worth.....don't buy new.  Just looks and plays like some 10 year old game....in the era of Crysis, Dead Space etc, this is just horribly done game.  Those who give it such high ratings much have low expectations.	1
This is a boring game. The gameplay was losted with this title and there is a waste of money at the end.I bought this game for $30.00 and selling finished at $7.00	1
59.99 I could not understand why this game was so much for pc if you get it threw digital download make's no sense. If they would have had a beta for this game i would have so past on it. If your going to make us overpay for game's on pc they better meet epicness standards.	1
Not very good, A little confusing and boring, I guess kids could play it as well but there are much better games out there	1
I am a tech kind of guy..fix my own computers..and was not able to make that think work.For the average Joe out there I honestly do not think is a good choice.	1
If you looking for a good fighting game, look some place else.  I honestly would be more entertained with Street Fighter 2 for the Super Nintendo.....	1
Cars 2 is good movie. But it has to be horrible with the game. The directions course looks like a glitch called Vanollpe. The cars are slow. The courses suck! Even more stuff sucks. Buyer beware!	1
I have never owned a game that has crashed as frequently as Fallout New Vegas. I've updated my video drivers, rolled back my video drivers, tried every patch and fix I could find. The game continues to crash at least a dozen times a day, usually when entering a building. Shame on Bethesda for releasing garbage like this.	1
my game was very short lived, as i couldn't get past that first scene.  it seemed like something wasn't working correctly.	1
When I got my son an extra set of Nunchuck Controller Combo my son never told me that they weren't working properly until it was way to late, one time I ask him and he told me that he though I would be mad and I couldn't exchange or return because I had long thrown away the box and receipt.	1
I got these and sent them back since they look awful.  These are very difficult to put on, and I'm no stranger to putting screen protection on devices I've done them countless times.  As a alternative I used a invisible shield for note 3 and trimmed it a bit and it looks great.	1
do not play this game no pc version yet ! they want you to buy xbox one ! I've superb sli system why should I buy your ddr3 xbox one version come on !!!	1
the game requires steam and an Internet connection!It is notdrm free!I would rather play PC Games without any kind of drm an restrictions like steam, securom or so.	1
Only one side worked and the batteris didnt hold the charge that long. I threw this away within a week,	1
Loved 1 & 2 but this one is just not right. Planes are LAME and vehicles are sometimes too powerful or way too useless. I don't know... I think I'm done with this series. Maybe MW3 should do (hopefully).	1
because I found the game very, very, very boring and repetitive. I love SP ,the show-  I enjoyed the graphics and some things cartman threw out there were hilarious - but the gameplay itself? BORING. returned it to redbox same day.	1
NIntendo is stuck in the SNES era. This game is not next gen. What's the point of having a gamepad if this game doesn't use it. Step your game up Nintendo.	1
I was so excited to get this game because I love BEP. The character change is annoying and I don't like it.The moves are weird, and hard to follow. I still love all the Just Dance games, and the MJ experience better.	1
I only paid $35 for this but 2 weeks after I got it they announce Ultimate. THANK GOD I didn't pay full retail for this game, I also got lucky because a friend of mine didn't mind giving me $30 for this game.	1
This is a great game, but the fact that it is on Xbox one ruins it. If it was on ps4 i would give it 5 stars, but oh well	1
It worked once.... and that's it. I tried using it again, and the LED lights just turn on when I plug it to the outlet and then turn off. It no longer charges. Was only useful for one control, and the charge lasted a couple of days. It's completely unusable right now. Seriously, you'd be better off with rechargeable batteries.	1
Game is actually great... But I have to give 1 star for Atlus's Decision to region lock the game. I personally;y have a Japanese PS3 and cant play it. This was done so Japanese people don't buy the US game since its cheaper. Still, this makes me angry since I just bought it and now cant play it.	1
This game is great on ps4 because it is 1080, but it is only 720 on xbox one.So go buy a ps4 for this game	1
You have high chances to lose your money, be careful :/ I redeemed the code many times with different accounts in both my ps4 and Ps3 and it just says error ......it doesn't start to download I feel robbed......I even try with my account in the USA and it didn't work...	1
This game is neverending. My son loves it, you can do so much in it. It goes on for ever. Now I see why it took them so long to release this game.. The graphics are excellent.. I highly recommend Grand Theft Auto V for the Xbox 360.	2
These are two fantastic games for the $10.00 I paid. Originally I played both on the XBOX but have since traded them in, but I could not resist the price on Amazon. Just a fantastic addition to the Batman franchise.	2
This extension cable rocks. Not only does it work great with all of the PS3 accessories that I threw at it, it works to extend my iPhone and iPad changing cables as well. Also VERY HIGH quality.	2
I love this game.  The animations are superb and I like that you can toggle between Mahjongg and the HO scenes. So if you are stuck, there's another way to move forward.	2
if you are tire of playing first person shooter then this is the game you must try.very unique and very additive and you won't get bore. its too bad that so many people think call of duty is the only game to play on ps3 or xbox 360.  hopefully more different genre game come out in the future.	2
For the price even if you purchased these titles before is well worth it.Amazon has amazing deals on games I have never had trouble installing or playing.	2
It is very good game similar to silent hill for the use of flashlights and stuff but without leaving aside the virus infecting both on the boat I recommend it has graphics and sounds very good, I loved just that not the play late at night after no sleep	2
I just got the game no more than 10 minutes ago, and love it. I have always thought x-box was the way to go, but had to have this game. played it at my friends and it is the best. i am glad to get this game and to have switched to ps3.	2
The game got here really fast and in excellent condition!  It is an excellent hidden object game.  This is my second I Spy game and it is as good as I Spy Castle.	2
I love this game even if the new characters are kind of dumb and they are missing db and dbgt characters still a pretty good game	2
Flameslinger was one of my first of the skylanders.  I used the hell out of him due to his distance fighting.  nothing better then killing the enemy from a distance! Great addition and solid character.	2
Cant go wrong with this tetris game. Tons of modes and different games in this one. Bought for my sister as a gift and she loves it. Huge tetris fan. Look to get under $20.	2
I finished Arkham Asylum and I was very impressed and how good the game was. This one takes the cake and I was immersed in this story. The controls are awesome and the enemies feel really menacing.Totally recommended for batman fans and videogame lovers	2
Great for all ages! WE love all of the Lego games for the wii!  We want more and more please!	2
Very hard to find character even when the first series was out. I like this character a lot and it was worth the wait.	2
I am (admittedly) a PS3 fanboy however my kids have been wanting this for a long time.  When the price was right on Black Friday, I finally gave in and pulled the trigger.  They have not been disappointed and so far I have, grudgingly, enjoyed it too!	2
This product came on time. Im a big AC fan! Will buy more in the future as the franchise grows.	2
This is more fun than Grand Theft Auto because there are cheats you can you to get unlimited ammo and you can go around killing people and blowing things up for no reason.	2
this is the best cover for the vita. all the buttons and ports are accessible easily. best one by far	2
In my opinion this is the best soccer game ever. It has very realistic 'physics' and if you really do ;hard work' learning most of the tricks during the 'training' tutorials, then you can do magic.	2
This has two screen protectors for the Nintendo 3DS. One for the top glass screen and one for the lower screen. Both are needed to keep your 3DS in good shape. Nintendo used a poor glass top screen that gets pits and scratches so easily. The protector keeps that from happening. Also, there is now an easy application method!	2
The graphics were great and it felt like you were right there. It was scary sometimes and it had great story line. The ending really through me. I wasn't expecting it to end like that. It was a great game.	2
This is the best basketball game ever. Graphics are awesome and players look and play like real life. I like this game better than 2K 12. Playing as Jordan and his great Bulls' teams is awesome.	2
The Xbox controller is really becoming the staple of game pads I think, the form factor is just great.I've had mine for over six months now, and I absolutely love it. Use it almost daily and still no issues. Receiver has a good range, and battery life seems to be pretty good.	2
I had high expectations for bioshock infinite, and I must say it exceeded them all.I played the game three times through back to back to back over the first two weeks I had it just to get everything I could out of it.	2
This zippered blanket for the car seat is really easy to set up and insulates really well.  In cold weather it does a great job of keeping out any precipitation and wind.  Highly recommended.Zips easily on and off.  Easy to wash as well.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This sheet is very very soft - feels like flannel. Fits the pack and play perfectly and have washed it several times.  Would highly recommend.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My granddaughter was over the moon with this. That was nice, as all products from this movie were soooo expensive it was all I could afford!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Bought this for a friend's 5 yr old who is very much into &#34;good guy/bad guy&#34; figures. He loved them. They are of good quality and it is a nice set of characters.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Got one for my grandson last year so our grand daughter gets one this year!  Future athletes for sure and this is the perfect toy to practice.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We love this diaper pail. It's really easy to use and it keeps the odor in really well. Will purchase again.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 3-year-old kept asking me for 'letters' for Christmas, not sure what that meant, but she received this and was quite happy. It is helping her learn her letters and has even started sounding out which sound each letter makes as she puts it in the slot.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
this was easy to assemble and exactly what I needed to be able to bring baby home from hospital in.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These work great with the Melissa & Doug Deluxe Grocery Store. Very realistic and they hold up wonderfully despite the kids pretend eating them (they still scrape their teeth on them). They are easily cleaned and actually look nice in the little store. With Melissa & Doug it's always a win!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I like getting a new set of cards to keep mixing things up! They never disappoint and keep the laughter going!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
ROAR is a good song and has a great message for young teen girls.  We uploaded it to the music list mostly so I could use it in my Daughters DVD that I was making for her.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
They arrived as expected! They are a good quality band for the rainbow loom.  I would recommend these to a friend.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 6 year old was able to put this puzzle together in less than an hour with very little assistance. The colors are bright, and the scene quite attractive. The only complaint might be that it turned out to be too easy for her.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is one of the imaginext toys that I couldn't find in my local stores. It's a great price/value. Holds up to the Imaginext toys I have purchased previous. My 4 yr old son loves this toy but he is a huge super hero/ Imaginext fan.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My 18 month old grandson had just come interesting in Thomas the Train. He really enjoys pushing the train around and making the doors open and close so the trains enter and exist. A Fun and enternaining toy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
But after awhile her whining just gets on your nerves. I bought it listened to it for a week or two and then deleted it out of my library and I'm happier without this song.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This has been perfect for my little guy who likes to chew on everything! I know he will be safe and it keeps the crib from being damaged as well. I went with the brown so it would match the wood on his crib. It blends in well. I am happy with this purchase!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This mat  is great for a baby that is just learning to crawl or is sitting up. Its soft enough to not heart your baby in case he/she falls and hard enough for baby to be able to crawl and roll over easily.I highly recommend this mat.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is exactly what I wanted for my 8-month old baby--a crib sheet that is minky soft, warm, fits the mattress well, and washes well. If winter were coming, I would order more of these!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We use these around our house for rainy days or bored faces.  We use them for face painting.  You just dip the pencil tip into water for about 30 seconds and there you have it.  Draw away!  The best part is that they clean up so easy.  Much better than face paint.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
