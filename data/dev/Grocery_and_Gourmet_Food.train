Tasteless and rubbery. So sad because I have a ton of the stuff left. It is going to go to a food shelf. I even feel bad taking it there!	1
This has been my number one all time favorite candy for years but I won't be buying it again.  They've changed the formulation and it's no longer any good.  I'm sure the change was dollar motivated and, guess what, they won't be getting any more of MY dollars.	1
All the Crystal Light products are sweetened with aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal).  Aspartame is 10% methanol--that is, wood alcohol.  There are more complaints at FDA about aspartame than any other thing they govern.  Studies have also shown that aspartame can contribute to weight gain.  Be careful, be very careful, in even considering any product containing aspartame.	1
The box came broken and damaged.  Coffee went every where.  This has never happened.  Timothy's World coffee.  Perfectly Pumkin.	1
These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these "thin crisps" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.	1
In general, I like coconut. This was awful. At first it was really watery and progressively became more concentrated even though I shook it several times. The packaging was pretty neat, but that is the only positive thing I have to say which is rather sad.	1
The burgers were tasteless. No flavor or even salt at all. I don't know why, but I do know that it doesn't worth the money. I would not accept them even if they were for FREE!	1
This tastes like gummy green fish. The wafers are paper thin. They melt on your tonge and turn into a chewy fishy nastiness that gets stuck in your teeth! I read all these great rewiews but I disagree. These things are really gross.	1
This bar was a let down in comparison to the Chocolate Raspberry version.  I would not buy again. Densly packed with calories (300), 18g fat (6g saturated), 28g carbs (18g sugar), and bland. I would rather spend my calories elsewhere. It has a weird aftertaste, too.	1
The worst raspberry salad dressing available. The flavors (olive oil?) are fighting each other. It smells atrocious... like someone's dirty feet after pouring vinegar on them. And the odor lingers in the air, driving you to distraction.It will certainly make you wash your dishes quickly. There are amazing Raspberry salsad dressing put there. This isn't one. Disgusting	1
It didn't work well for me in the microwave. Will not purchase a 2nd time.	1
I threw it away. It tasted bad. It was bitter and tasted wierd. Maybe I got a bad batch or something.	1
I did not like this product because the chips did not taste good. They also were very soggy when tring to eat them	1
bought them, wanted to love them, started to boil, smells like corn, surprised.... checked out the ingredients...says corn first, that means that there are more corn rather than quinoa .. :((( liers	1
i guess that i was expecting something "chunkier"it tastes like salty mush to me - i started adding it to big pots of chili to try to use it up	1
All the Snickers Bars had a weird chemically or rancid taste that I could not place, and I had to toss them out... itwas really disgusting.	1
Bought this under the influence of many positive reviews.  I'm sorry to say that I found this produce upalatable, unacceptable.  It manages to be both insipid and bitter, leaves a nasty aftertaste, and has none of the mouthfeel of peanut butter. I'm returning it right away.	1
For all the saturated fat and sugar these bars just aren't good.  They don't satisfy a chocolate craving and the protein content isn't significant at 4g.I would not purchase again.	1
So disappointed. They changed the recipe and now this has a nasty aftertaste. My first try was in the assorted pack and I loved this flavor. Bummer.	1
I STOPPED USING THIS WHEN I FINALLY STOPPED AND READ THE LABEL. I DO NOT HAVE A DESIRE TO BE LOADED WITH PLASTIC IN MY SYSTEM.	1
I was greatly disappointed. Compared to Black Jack gum this stuff is a complete failure. Not only no flavor but also feels like your eating pure sugar. Yuk!	1
The other reviews about this salt is true. Don't buy it. I have no clue where the heck this stuff came from and what it is made of. It's a scam.	1
Overall decent taste, but not what I expected.  Also did not expect this to be coconut water from CONCENTRATE. I will read the fine print better next time.  100% pure coconut water is always better IMHO.The added sugar would not really be necessary if it's pure coconut water, not from concentrate.	1
What are the nutrients of this product. I can google this but why is not listed? It is food and this is usually a deal breaker for me.	1
It is appalling to me that anybody would think that Tuscan milk would be anywhere near as good as good old fashioned American milk!  These colors don't run!	1
I have purchased many SodaMix syrups and this one was very disappointing.The taste was flat.  That's the only way we can describe it.  My sons and I bothagreed it was just not up to what we know as a cream soda such as A&W;.	1
I will not buy this again all the grocery and personal items such as six bars of soap items were thrown together with no care as to breakage or damage.	1
Would love to send the unused product back.  The taste is awful, tried cooking with it in soups etc., the broth remained unsatifying.  Should have tried your product before ordering large amount.	1
Got this do to reviewers saying it cleans out the dishwasher... nope. Do not believe it! Maybe OK for drinking (didn't try it...), but to clean your dishwasher? No way!	1
I should have read the reviews before ordering this product.  As other reviewers indicate, you do not get what is advertised (Spicy World Indian Ghee) but you get USA made "Joy" Ghee.  No seal to insure is the genuine product (and what about contamination and hygiene!!!)Amazon should be ashamed of offering this product.	1
So sad they changed these bars... they were one of the few snacks my nut allergy kid liked as a treat. He took one bite of the new ones and said, &#34;These taste terrible!&#34; Now I'm stuck with 6 boxes of useless bars. Please bring back the old recipe.	1
Thank you Green Mountain Coffee for Not labeling the cinnamon. It would be great other than that. I loved over and over to make sure there was no cinnamon in it as I am allergic. But Yes It has a lot of cinnamon. Not the spicy cinnamon you can smell either...	1
If anything is Pasteurized or Homogenized the Enzymes and the needed Nutrients that are Truly Beneficial to YOUR body are DEAD!!!So Why bother!!!Your Body needs RAW - Organic - available at Whole Foods - Google it...there is a raw brand available.God Bless & Be Well!	1
i was excited to get this. Hoped for a peanut butter replacement. I realized it would not taste the same as peanut butter but was willing to compromise. OMG this was horrid!! I tried it a few different ways but just could not do it. I had to throw it out. Waste of money!	1
These were expensive and tasted terrible! I love ramen and noodles in general, but these were abysmal! The sauce was mostly a type of soy/worcestershire sauce flavor. I like both but this was just terrible, especially for how much they cost i ate two tubs and threw the rest away i will never order these again.	1
I was looking for an alternative to malted milk powder and the reviews state that this was even more malty than that. And its not. Its gross and mild.	1
I don't usually have a problem with the taste of ice cream alternatives, but this one didn't cut it for me. It was bland and I couldn't pick up any 'peanut butter' flavor.	1
Which makes it the most expensive box of granola bars EVER.  Yes, it was too good to be true, but since nobody had reviewed it, I had to give it a go.	1
just yakisoba FAVOR. not yakisoba.it is not that bad but kind of greasy.just yakisoba FAVOR. not yakisoba.it is not that bad but kind of greasy.	1
I've tried a number of gf muffin mixes, and this is by far the worst. They have a very weird texture and the taste is unpleasant. I do not recommend these at all. Try another Namaste mix.	1
Usually himalyan berries are jucy these are like little rocks.  Also being chinese they have a sulfer taste like bad preservatives and a nutty flavor from the processing plant.  I have trouble even using these to cook.  Thought they were the good ones like u get in the store.	1
This coffee used to be similar to dunkin donuts.  Now it is just colored water.  Big time fail!  It shouldn't cost this much for weak coffee.	1
This product contains GMO's Known to cause Cancer and Organ Failure, Im sorry but I will not be feeding my family your cereal anymore until you use safer ingredients. Shame on you	1
This is worse than my worst try at making noodles and teriyakiAs stated before noodles are mushy taste like soup noodlesThe flavor is nasty like weird lemon pee with sesame seedsYUK !!!!!	1
I like the creaminess of cappuccino when ordered at a coffee shop.  This coffee was no different than any of Gloria Jean's Kcups.  Even adding milk to the brewed product still made is taste ho hum.	1
After reading the reviews I thought I'd try these curry noodles. What A Mistake, YUK!	1
I wanted to make some yummy miso soup, so I bought this Dashi. I make homemade food for the health of my family and guests. I was really disappointed to purchase something loaded with MSG. Maybe I can give it away to someone who doesn't care about carcinogenics.	1
This product claims it is "Simply Salted", though a read of ingredients I soon discover it has soybean oil.	1
Four of the six packs of buns were moldy when I recieved the order and had to be thrown away.	1
This bread was not good :( It was really dry and tasted like cardboard. I would suggest Bobs Redmill breads - they are the best I have found that are gluten free.	1
I spoke with the company after the quality went down and learned that the salmon is no longer in BPA free cans and that they used up the labels saying BPA free. To me, this is fraudulent but obviously, this company got away with it.The quality has gone down too.	1
These are low-quality crunchy cookies, similar to Chips Ahoy. I don't know how anyone could confuse these with "home-made" cookies. Brown packing doesn't mean it's healthy or any better for you or the environment. These are still factory-made sugar and fat bombs, "natural" ingredients or not. Buyer beware.	1
What a rip off. Buy someplace else, Lucky Vitamin or Vitacost. I am surprised Amazon has this seller.Every where else it is $11..Otherwise a good product, really sweet. Just terrible price here of 39!!	1
I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this, but it was too sweet even for me. I even tried adding water, but that didn't help. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, so I can't comment on the brand in general, but I'll never try this flavor again.	1
This was my first experience with &#34;sun-ripened&#34; fruit, so I'm not sure if it's really all that bad or if I just don't like it.  I thought it was disgusting, and it all kind of tasted the same.	1
Yuck. Extra extra hard, bad flavor, leave a weird feeling & flavor in my mouth, and almost no salt.Find another gluten free pretzel, there are really good ones out there!	1
I'm not sure what I was expecting with this product as it's sodium free, but my first use of it just made me throw it out. Not a pleasant taste at all.	1
Very strong flavor of the decaf process.  Don't bother buying this tea.  If you want good English Breakfast get Twinnings.	1
REally wanted to like this but it has no taste.  Now I am stuck with 4 canisters.	1
Got the package here in Afghanistan.  Cans were all damaged, but the packaging was intact? Hmmm.  The cans that were not damaged went Ok.  Lost 5 in all.	1
Pacific Chicken broth is very good. This vegetable broth has a horrendous perfume aftertaste. Yuk! I practically ruined a stir fry using this. I sprinkled some sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds on to mask the flavor, but it was still there.	1
This cookie has no chocolate flavor.  The texture is gritty and crumbly.I would not buy them again.	1
Although the package label says Extra Sugarfree Gum, that is not what is in the package.The package contains gum with sugar.  It is Wrigley's Winterfresh which lists sugar as the first item in the ingredients.	1
At first sip it's not that bad.  But after I finished the cup I had a horrible bitter taste in my mouth for a long time after.  I had to chew a peice of gum to get rid of it.  I won't buy this one again.	1
The box arrived 1.5 months after ordering, hence the initial 1 start (after waiting for a month.The snack is not that bad, but the chocolate feels cheap and sticky, and doesn't feel like a healthy snack.	1
This company uses cheap products from Chinathat are poisen. (remember when Veggie Booty was recalled 2 years ago?)Plus, this product is anything but healthy, get real.	1
The Newman's Own peppermints are very poor quality, hardly any peppermint taste. I anticipated their being good, and bought a few packs. I was so disappointed, I threw away 2 packs. Why can't they add enough peppermint flavor to make them not taste like carrots, which is what they taste like now. Terrible.	1
I found this oddly fibrous and inedible. It was almost like there was paper or rubber in my mouth as I chewed on this. At first I thought it was just that stick, so I opened another one and it was exactly the same!	1
I had a bad reaction to XyloSweet that lasted all day and half the evening (2 teaspoons).  I won't go into the details, but it kept me from leaving the house or getting too far away from the bathroom :(  If you don't have a reaction to it, you might like it, tastes like sugar.	1
found walmart brand to be made with splenda - taste equally good - and cost a lot less	1
Stale, tastless crap. Dont bother. The hassle to return is riduclous, you have to pay and it has to be thrown out anyway, Why put customer thru all this for cheap little item.	1
It tastes like cardboard with a subtle flavoring of mocha.  The granola bar is so dry and tasteless, I have to drink something with it in order to even swallow.  I love most Kashi products, but this one fails imho.	1
The first ingredient is Sugar, the second ingredient is SALT....what ?  The descriptions says &#34;unseasoned&#34;.  Oh, and this item is UNRETURNABLE.....They should at least tell the buyer the ingredients first.	1
Any country that repeatedly has safety warnings on nearly everything produced should not be exporting food.  Additionally a country that has millions upon millions of people starving, should not be exporting food.  Shame on this company for finding the lowest cost producer to safe a few dimes.	1
The title says it all! Not good for diabetics! Stores need to take off shelf and stop promoting as diabetic freindly sweetner.	1
the review is about the 'heavenly hazelnut chocolate' bar.  ingredients are always listed by how much is in there, so check this:"Cashews, organic agave nectar, organic sunflower seed kernels, dates, cocoa processed with alkali, hazelnuts, almonds, sprouted flax seed."now you see how much hazelnut is really in there:  very little!!!!!	1
each one of these is about the size of a quarter and there is a spot of white on the top which leads me to believe that there is cream on the inside ----- perhaps the size of a dime ------- there is no taste and the whole thing is a joke...	1
First, I'm a big natural health nut, having used Stevia for about 20 years.This really has no flavor at all. That is, it doesn't sweeten.Bad buy, bad product.	1
Maybe it's just luck of the draw but I found this coffee stale and as bland as Folger's from an old opened can.  Never again for me.	1
Really really.... nasty. Don't recommend wasting your money on this. Oh and when mine came the cheap plastic lid was broken. Thanks Amazon.	1
Buy something else. Hydrogenated fats are an unnatural product whereby hydrogen is attached to the fat molecule making it thicker.	1
Great Tuna but ...price up in last 6 months ... 50% on the 12 oz cans and %100 on the 6 oz cans .. case of 12 ... sorry ... been ordering this for some time .. .but no more	1
I had to cut it half and half with milk to drink it.  They market this drink as healthy and think we won't notice or care about all of the sugar!	1
So looking forward to drinking 100% coconut water, but instead I got coconut water with sugar, which I cannot have w/SIBO condition.  What's up with the description of 100%?? Buyer beware!	1
Absolutely one of the blandest things i have ever tasted.  I wouldnt be surprised if the box had more flavor.	1
This is not the same as Ativa Dandelion tea.  This one feels a little weird and honestly I don't suggest it.	1
Full of sugar, drinking this on an empty stomach made my heart race and made me feel feint (screwing with my blood sugars I assume).  The taste is rather nice but I can't recommend this at all ... you're better off drinking water with a splash of fresh fruit juice	1
Other Walden Farms products are great, but this one is disgusting!  I couldn't get past a tiny taste.  My husband (who will eat ANYTHING) thought it was nasty and wouldn't eat it.  To the trash bin this goes!  Save yourself!  Do not buy this product!  Blech!	1
Great product but they keep rising the price, making it more expensive than buying local. Oct 2010 the price was 11.96 for 12 with subscription. Oct 2011, the price is 14.42. Individual price has increased from .99 to $1.20 in one year.	1
The first bowl of this had gone bad.  If the other bowls are better, I'll update and let you know.	1
I was very excited to get these Tapioca Pearls to make bubble tea. They arrived a powdery blob of mess in the bag. It looked like someone dropped the bag and kicked it around until it was turned into mostly dust.	1
The texture is fine but this has a very odd background flavor to it. I've tried to place it and think it might be from the coconut but I'm just not sure. Though I enjoyed this brand's Oatmeal Raisin granola, I would never buy this flavor again.	1
Didn't like it that it felt like I was eating dirt with a bit of flavor..I didn't even finish the pack...for something GF that's sweet, I'll just stick to EnviroKidz Crispy Rice, Schar's hazelnut bars, or Mi-Del arrowroot cookies..	1
These don't really taste like Teriyaki, and they're a bit... soggy? I have been feeding them to the cat, but it's a little expensive for cat food and even she doesn't really like them.	1
Pack of 8 Campell soup listed for $51.00 regular? Lol....What grocery store sells them for that price? They must be kidding right?  Now on sale for what? You can buy them in any store for a little over 1.00 each! On sale even less... ....Bogus Prices-Bogus-Prices... This grocery site is not for me...	1
I chose this rating because a high sugar content was not revealed online before buying it. Might as well have bought real brownies.	1
They have modified the recipe.  My kids don't like them any more.  Just as well, since who really needs more cookies in their life?	1
I really want to love this flour.  Bob's Red Mill usually makes such great products!  This flour has a very distinct unpleasant taste.  I have used it to make pizza and baked goods and unfortunately the horrible taste always comes through.  I prefer to use a mix of gluten free flours instead.	1
These have no flavor. They all taste the same. They are way too sweet and my kids don't even like themAnd they love gummy candy.	1
I've already reviewed this way back in April, but for whatever reason you didn't publish it...I found it MOST AWFUL!	1
Awesome product, will buy again! So happy to have found this flour.it's the best superfine flour that I have found so far.	2
Wonderful tasting tuna for tuna fish sandwiches or on a hard roll with capers/onions/mayonaise. I do not taste a hint of the "tinny" flavor some other brands have. I will definitely purchase this again from Amazon as it is a better value than any grocery store in our area.	2
We used to eat steel-cut oats, but found that we prefer this hot cereal instead. It has more variety in the grains, is sugar-free, and is quite easy to make in the microwave. And with Subscribe & Save, the unit price is much lower than what you'll typically find in stores.	2
.. using Oregon Fruit canned items. I use this gelatin along with the leftover juice to make a healthier version of Jello, which is an extremely easy process via following the directions on the can. Very grateful that the company makes using gelatin from grass fed cows a priority.	2
I loved the price and the fact I could order the case. This tasted absolutely divine!	2
Now I understand what was holding my sauce back from being true "gravy"! It was my good but not GREAT tomatoes. Now I have to see if I can lower the cost at all in my local market 'cause I feel the need, the need for .....	2
Perfect size for those on-the-go. Each packed in a serving size up. This is a variety pack which will include the more sugary of Kellogg's cereal (apple jacks).	2
A nice even taste, with a hint of chocolate in there, strong enough to wake you up and keep you that way when your driving.I like to take it on my way to work.	2
Remember: this product comes in a plastic bottle.  Trying to use it as a Molotov cocktail will prove detrimental to your social status.	2
I've been buying the YummyEarth Organic Lollipops for years and my kids and grandkids love them. The grandkids always remember there will be lollipops in the cupboard at Grandma's house, and I am happy to give them a treat with no artificial ingredients! (I like them occasionally, too - the flavors are great!)	2
making homemade coconut milk. I use two cups of this to eight cups of water and than blend it up for 2-3 minutes and than strain through a nut milk bag. Very tasty and when the fats seperate after refrigerating you have coconut oil/fat you can put in other recipes or use for cooking.	2
What can I say, it is pepper. It is 100% black pepper as stated on the package. The pepper is quite flavorful and spicy and I am very happy with the purchase.	2
There are only a couple groceries store that offer Orbit at this price, that I've seen. The only benefit to getting them cheaper is if you need the variety. I have my favorites, so I decided to buy this pack from  Amazon. Taste pretty nummers, and I got them for a great price. No complaints here. A+	2
This is for sure one of the best teas I have ever tasted. The lavender flavor is just right. Absolutly delicious tea! Will be buying again for sure!	2
Been using this for a very long time and it has a great taste.  It has the sweet taste that I love.  Glad that I can get it on Prime.	2
I've long been a fan of the NOW brand and recently jumped on the chia seed wagon since my gf is a fan of the little seeds health benefits.  I don't use the product everyday, but when I do, the product appears to be high quality.	2
This is a delicious herb tea, with a distinct yet mild strawberry flavor, great for iced tea.	2
Very nice quality - just what I was looking for.  I keep it in a bamboo salt keeper, and can swing open the cover and grab a pinch!  I like that the minerals are there, instead of some additives!!	2
Not too sweet and just so tasty.Great snack anytime too.This granola is the best I have ever had.	2
This is diferent since you get diferent flavors , is delicious and will be puting it in autoship, this was my first purchase.	2
I usually use fresh ginger but I will not be able to leave home for a couple of months and I missed my ginger tea, now I brew green tea and add to it a good amount of this ginger  and some organic honey, few drops of lemon juice and have an amazing tea.	2
I love these.  It can be a bit thick if you don't stir it well or add enough water but the taste is still good.  I like the added lime	2
great and sweet-I am diabetic and this hot cocoa mix in my 2 cups of coffee in the morning is a pick me up and tastes great....  :)	2
We're enjoying this chili powder and the package is so large I've shared it out with friends, so it won't lose its umph before I could use it all.	2
we have a large family and use a large amount of Coffee Mate it seems to be the only creamer the family is happy with	2
This is the only k-cup I've found so far that seems to match the smokey flavor of Starbucks coffees.So if you like that flavor buy this. If you think Starbucks tastes like burnt coffee, then this one's probably not for you.	2
Great gift for any coffee drinker, very nice assortment.  One pack per pot, impressive boxing, wide variety of flavors.  Highly recommend	2
The taste was superb. They aren't too dry. Some nutrition type bars can be dry.	2
Great cookies.  These are very crunchy.  Not at all soft.  Very nice taste.Would recommend.	2
I love maple syrup but not the calories. So I stumbled by accident onto this amazing syrup that I love! My diabetic friends will all get a lifetime supply of this stuff!	2
I bought this coffee for myself because I like strong, bold coffee and this is perfect. The price was good and it arrived quickly.	2
These cashews are really really delicious! I was surprised at how large the cashews were and there were very few broken pieces.	2
What can I say? It's salt! Tastes great and grinds just fine in my salt grinder. Has a really nice taste. Highly recommend.	2
TO BEGIN WITH, PRUNES ARE DELICIOUS AND GOOD FOR YOU. WITH A GOOD CEREAL PRUNES ADD AN ELEMENT TO KEEP ME REGULAR. SIMPLY SPOKEN, IT WORKS..SUNMAID MAKES A GREAT PRODUCT THAT I HAVE ENJOYED MANY TIMES. FRANKLY SPOKEN, THEY ARE DELICIOUS.	2
I use this product to make vegan almond anise biscotti that gets raves from everyone who tries it (and doesn't dislike anise!)  I wish I could find it cheaper, but other brands have been subpar.	2
I like all of Bob's Red Mill products and this flaxseed is just great. I put 2 tablespoons into my smoothie in the morning and regularity is a given. It is also good to lower cholesterol. Sprinkle it on cereal is another good way to get this into your system.	2
This is one of the better sore throat teas I've found, and trust me, I went through quite a few teas!  The taste alone would make this tea worth drinking, but the mint and other flavors make it especially soothing.  It also helps quiet a cough.  This is a lovely tea with benefits!	2
I like these dried cranberries, they are moist and not too dry. Great for mixing with hot oatmeal and as a snack on their own.	2
I avoided this product for years because their fettuccine went from quite a bit under to total much in seconds. Tried over and over. Bought the spaghetti due to Amazon reviews and was delighted to find that it cooks up nicely- a bit sticky-chewy in a pleasant way.	2
My mom dropped off a box of this over the holiday and we loved it so much I had to find it online. Absolutely delicious honey butter cornbread. I make it with melted Country Crock. Compliments almost any meal and is delicious by itself as a snack.	2
This was a good tasting drink. We liked it better than silk. My daughter takes it in her lunch and she is able to open the containers on her own(kindergarten). Will buy again.	2
This is a great muesli. The only sugar in it comes from date crumbles. I eat it for breakfast and I don't feel hungry until the afternoon. A great source of vegetarian protein!	2
I always try to keep a jar of this honey on hand for wounds and infections.My husband just recently had a staph infection and we used the Manuka Honey to help clear it up.It also works well in hot tea for colds and sinus infections.	2
Cheaper than red bull by far. Same great taste, same caffeine-induced psychosis. This is one of the sodastream flavors that is hard to find cheap anywhere. If you find it under five bucks, buy out the inventory.	2
This is an absolute for bean and whole grain cooking. for preparing broth for soups and sauces....it is THE key ingredient. Honestly I have to have it in the pantry always....especially in the winter when fresh greens are scarce.	2
What more can I say? This is delicious and comes out of the Keurig with plenty of flavor to spare (some do get watery, you know!) This is scrumptious and soul-soothing! Enjoy!	2
With food there are always the pernickity ones. They complain about salt, they complain about this and that.This is a fast meal that's a helofalot better than many foods at the fast food shops and that is all that it is meant to be.If you want cuisine don't expect to get it in a $2 meal.	2
I use the regular Bob's flax meal that's brown in color, but my hubber didn't like it. I bought a bag of this golden type, and he absolutely loves it! I tried it, and it was okay, but I just really love the flavor of the regular flax. So I buy both varieties on Amazon's subscribe and save program.	2
These noodles make me want to move to Asia. If instant noodles can taste this good, the real thing is probably amazing.	2
The flavor is good but I don't know if it helps me think more clearly. I do however take a bunch of vitamins already so I may not need it.	2
I use this and tend to use less sugar which works for me and my new health plan. Great in tea, lemonade, sweetening my Cream of Rice etc. Love it, love it, love it! White sugar sucks!	2
I put organic parsley in my smoothies because it is so good for the body, having lots of nutrients, including zinc. I find this to be a good quality organic parsley and also a good deal price wise. Parsley also helps prevent indigestion.	2
OMG this stuff is soooo adicting and guilt free, dip apples, dip bananas, dip grapes, dip wasa crackers and they taste sinful!!! but they aren't : )	2
The Torani brand of syrups all taste good.  No after taste.  I use peach for both hot and iced-tea. (Never tried it in coffee)  Both the hot and iced-tea are exceptional gooood!	2
This is an excellent product. I actually add it to my oatmeal giving a good maple flavor and an occasional pancake. Coombs Family Farms has been a go to for this product for many years. I would recommend this to all of my friends.	2
This is really good seeds. I never had raw seeds but for the healthy reason I ordered it. I will try other product from them as this order was such good deal. shipping was fast with free of charge.	2
High in price, but it has a great, fresh flavor. I may have to start making my own if the price continues to climb, but if you can catch it for a good price, then get it!	2
This product does what it is advertised to do. It makes a better night. I would recommend to give it a try and also any of the other Celestial Seasonings.	2
MY WIFE AND I LOVE DRINKING WHEATGRASS JUICE. WITH ALL THE CRAP THAT MAKES UP THE STANDARD AMERICAN DIET, EVERYONE COULD USE MORE GREENS IN THEIR DIET. AN 8-12 OUNCE SERVING DOES SUPPLY 5 SERVINGS OF VEGGIES FOR THE DAY! THAT IS AWESOME!	2
From time to time I buy similar small liquors for friends, usually at Christmas.  I discovered these during a random search on Amazon, and now have a superior product available.	2
This stuff is great! Very filling. I am a protein guy - that is I prefer a high protein breakfast, but this is so dense with nuts and oats and whole grains it does the trick.	2
Great for a kids who have a severe nut/milk/egg allergy.	2
My boys  love these - how wonderful they get their taste for dessert with something that's organic.	2
With 5 kids it's not easy to please all of them at the same time.  This variety box has all the right flavors.  They are crisp and fresh and come in flavors my kids like.  Good deal with the $10 off coupon.	2
Lately, I have been baking a lot of bread, and yeast biscuits, and having two large packages of yeast on hand makes cooking easier and faster. When I open the second pack I know it will be time to order more. Thanks	2
I cook rice in my Oster rice cooker twice a week at least.  This rice is perfect every single time.I don't do white rice, only brown or wild; this is perfect for ALL my rice needs.	2
these have better flavor than ener-G brand and work great for jello pretzel salad. Even fools the non-celiac person with taste!	2
I love this tea, it's really sweet without sweetener! Love it. I probably drink three cups a day on average!!!	2
i love panda licorice, but had never tried this herbal kind. i love it. it's refreshing and has an interesting flavor.	2
These are a great low fat,low  calorie snack. They are a good option if you are looking for something sweet to eat. They are a peachy, crunchy bite.	2
I've purchased both the .097 oz 24 packs and the small 100 packs in both mild and regular.The mild and regular taste very similar and blindfolded I probably couldn't tell the difference. A great, if unhealthy snack that satisfies quickly. Cheap alternative to overpriced jerky.	2
This is a very high quality almond flour. I made cookies with it and they turned outwonderful. Very smooth and soft. The almond flour is the best....	2
I love KIND bars..these are my favs...very healthy, quick and convient snack...you can take them where ever you go..they are a ready to eat yummy treat.	2
Some people are amazed that I can put this chocolate out for customers who drink free coffee in the morning.  But some of them really like the chocolate flavor and my coffee &#34;kitty&#34; tip jar shows that.	2
Really good quality nuts, a combination of nuts that can't be beat. Large size and is recommended to meet nutritional needs.for once in a while occasions.	2
We have tried most of the Torani Sugar-Free Syrup flavors and have enjoyed all of them. The Caramel Syrup is also good and it goes well in my regular coffee and Frappes. Being a diabetic, it is fantastic that these great tasting Sugar-Free syrups are available and that they don't have a "fake" aftertaste.Highly Recommended!CFH	2
This is very good coffee, especially if you are looking for a dark roast. I would definitely purchase it again.	2
I've tried a bunch of different coffees in my Keurig and this is my favorite.  It smells so good when brewing and tastes great as well.  Smooth and tasty!	2
These caramel chocolates are sweet and rich.  I enjoyed them very much, but can't say that they're any better than any other mainstream milk chocolate with caramel.  I would recommend these to anybody with a sweet tooth who likes milk chocolate, caramel, and the convenience of having individually wrapped pieces.	2
It is nice to be able to make gluten free banana pudding for my child, everyone should have banana pudding at least once. Other family members loved it also.	2
I have used this to make a type of flatbread, thicken soups, make sauces, and in other kitchen adventures.  I highly recommend this a a kitchen stable.	2
This is a surprisingly tasty, cheap, and healthy snack or light meal.  I wish it had a stronger curry taste but for what it is it's great.  I also like that it isn't entirely white rice, and the raisins are an interesting touch.  Already on my second order and will probably return for a third!	2
Great tasting fruit leather.  Just enough to satiate the taste buds and each flavor is delicious.  Love that each is only 45 calories too.  Makes snacking fun and tasty again.	2
Great.  Tastes great.  Easy to use.  You seriously only use a few tabs per glass; treat it like you would sugar packets.  No bad aftertaste.  Love the flavor.  it's great.  It's even better if you combine it with sweet leaf stevia sugar substitute; the combination of the two is fantastic.	2
I use this as a face moisturizer and also to soften up my beard! It doesn't leave my face oily at all! I would use it in my hair, but alas, I am bald. :)	2
Taste great.  Kinda expensive though.  If you want premium foods, this is a good price.	2
Great tea- very flavorful.  I enjoy the fragrance a lot.  Some jasmine tea is too cloying, but this is just right for me.  It's not so strong I feel like I am drinking perfume, but it's strong enough that it has a lot of flavor.	2
I started using this because it's good for my joints.  I also have recently become wheat intolerant, too, and I used a bit of this gelatin \, in place of flour, as a thickener the last time I made stew, which worked well.  Now I need to think of other ways to get this into my diet.	2
I love these prepackaged servings.  I'm used to using the box and for some reason I could never Measure it right and my biscuits came out something to be desired. Never happens with these packages, they always come out right.	2
I use these in muffins and on top of peanut butter for a spin on pb and j.  We don't like the sweetness of jelly, but these are sweet/tart and add nice texture to any recipes.  Also good in homemade chocolate cookies.	2
This is absolutely wonderful.  My grocery store doesn't have it so when I saw it on the AMAZING Amazon, I ordered it.  I have ordered it ever since and will continue.	2
This is the first time I've tried this oatmeal.  I've been using steel cut for a long time and decided to give this a try.  It is excellent. I serve it with vanilla soy milk and a little agave syrup.  Like eating dessert.  This is the only oatmeal that I will serve.  TRY IT!!!!!	2
I'm all about the natural superfoods, so it's no surprise I got this.  Not only does it make you feel fuller for longer, it is also a natural thickener.  When my hummus looked a bit runny, I just added some chia to it and it thickened up really well.	2
and the price is right.  I enjoy these so much that they are on the automatic reorder plan.  I even use them in my cranberry bread.  Have you priced dried cranberries at you local supermarket?  These are very, very comprtively priced and delivered right to my door.  I highly reccomend them!	2
WHAT CAN I SAY IT'S CHOCOLATE, REALLY YUMMY, RICH, GOOEY, SWEET, AND GOOD.THIS ITEM ARRIVED ON TIME, I IMMEDIATELY PUT IT IN MY FREEZER. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I HAVE A SMILE ON FACE BECAUSE I WAS SATISFIED.	2
One can use this either as a waker upper beverage or as an after meal drink to settle the stomach and relax.  I like the taste and I like the effect it has on me.  I do prefer this to the black tea with ginger....but they're both good teas in my estimation.	2
I have loved popcorn since I was a kid but have always dreaded popcorn that is loaded with butter (e.g. movie theater popcorn)Not only is Newman's Own organic, it tastes exactly how I like it.  Not super buttery or salty, very light in flavour.  This is by far my favourite popcorn on the market!	2
Not too strong, nor weak, nor bitter.  Perfect.  This is my favorite coffee and when I occasionally make some one else a k-cup of Nantucket blend they always love it, too.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!	2
I use this syrup as a sweetener for my coffee and in smoothies. It tastes just as good as any other and I have yet to find anywhere that the price is even comparable to this one.	2
This pasta has a taste and texture very similar to traditional pastas.  If you order by the case, it's about half the price of buying at a health food store.	2
