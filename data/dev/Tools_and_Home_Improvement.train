The switch turned the light on and off at random times. We would turn it off at night and wake up with it on, sometimes it would just go on when we were standing near it. Had to return it	1
This battery is awful. Brand new fully charged will run on the milwaukee hatchet (6514) for may be 5 minutes.  It runs even less on the cordless circular saw. It needs a sticker that say "running hamster inside".  What a joke!	1
This is an expensive thermostat.  It is not easy to program.  Most importantly, our unit broke-down after only thirteen months.  That is about ten dollars a month just to operate/own this thermostat.  Very disappointing.	1
Please save your money. This shower head is a cheap piece of junk and will definitely break like all the claims state. It's a shame because it is a nifty shower head. They should just engineer it a little better and it will deserve the high rating some give it.	1
I have used tiny drill bits in the past, and I realize that they break relatively easily. But these are not only fragile, they are dull. Do not expect them to drill through any metal. They can't handle much more than metal clay (in its clay form).	1
still waiting to received this item after so long. i only received the router bit set and 16 inch square after so much months of waiting. that rating is for not receiving the item	1
Get a Dewalt.  The B&D products are not made as well and will not get through as many projects. Plus, the B&D batteries don't last very long at all.	1
I had great expectation for this sander but the included vacuum adapter was the RS007 for a 19mm hose, not the RS006 adapter for American sized hoses.  The Bosch web site says the RS006 adapter is included but it's not in the package.  The I'm not going to order the adapter (at extra cost), so it's going back.	1
The tip melted on first use. Tip surface was also rough, crudely made. Not a good product. Advice: don't buy.	1
I see no benefit whatever.  It does reduce the depth of cut from whatever your saw allows (3"+) to 2.5 inches.  For cutting hardwood with minimal burning, Forrest recommends setting the blade as high as possible. The stiffener limits it to 2.5" cut.	1
I purchased this charger to put life back into some of my old batteries for my 18V batteries from DEWALT.  It would not even charge them much less renew the life of the battery.  Returned the item for a full refund.  Company was good about refunding my purchase price.	1
The manual is horrible. There are multiple errors, and it leaves out any information about what screws and what washers go to what, which is important if you have 3 times the screws and washers that you need for some reason.	1
It was way to late to file a claim when I noticed that the #2-Phillips is simply missing, but this is disappointing nonetheless. In general, the quality is quite alright for minor everyday-fixes.	1
I bought this for a female friend who just moved and apparently the non slip bottom came off rendering it completely useless. Not sure what else messed up with it but she couldn't fix it.	1
After installing all 4 lights, lost 10 more chickens. It was a waste of money for me, but its thats just me.	1
purchased two and had to return them, both had scratches and dents.all the sets at two different stores had scratches.it has great features like bump-guard and ansi-1, but crappy quality finishes.i really wanted to use these locks.	1
It took 6 units (the original and 2 replacement orders) to get 2 working units.  A very poor quality unit.	1
Easy to install but watch for false alarms. Whenever my system goes off (and no smoke is present) I always check this unit. I end up pulling the batteries to get it to stop the alarm. Very frustrating. Look at you-tube under JoeBrownToolGuy if you want to see an install video.	1
I bought two packs of these.  I now regret it.  Seems I am changing these GE bulbs every month or less.  They are pure junk.  I have bought the Walmart brand, that was cheaper, and lasted alot longer.  DON'T BUY THESE bulbs, unless you enjoy donating to GE.	1
Poor quality garbage taiwan branded sockets you might buy at a dollar store. Any other set of sockets would be better. Avoid.	1
I bought this to get into the battery holder. It does not have the small screw driver in the set to do it! It does have different sized flat-heads and phillips, just not a real small Phillips.	1
The insert is junk it cracked and it sags wich means the material sticks when pusing through , not a good thing!  I do like the dual adujustable fences, makes setting one proud of the other a breeze.  BUT	1
once again, you must read the tool review for an explanation.  why is this company selling useless products, especially to consumers who want to make work easier?	1
Pulled out a small amount of hair, but otherwise seems to have made the clog worse. A waste of money.	1
The utility versus cost is not there for these blades.  While rated for metal, they are destroyed in one use it they encounter a nail or screw.	1
Worked for less than a week. Thought it was a bad battery, but still didn't work after replacing the battery. Tried to reporgram it and still didn't work. Requested to send it back and sellar never contacted me back.	1
This is annoying and hard to use.  There is no easy way to get the bits out.  You have to hold it upside down and shake it.  Clear plastic window gets scratched up and it becomes difficult to see what bit is coming up next in the carousel.  Do not buy.	1
Its the same story as others have said, 200 BF of hardwoods is all you will get out of these chinese blades.  I guess the china men haven't perfected sheffield steel yet.  I just bill my customers 50 bucks a project for the cost of me being stupid enough to buy another dewalt product/.	1
Purchased 2 of these batteries as a replacement for my original that finally died and I am not impressed with the quality. I don't know what the difference is between the battery that came with the tool verses these replacement batteries but they don't last long at all after a full charge. Definitely not worth buying.	1
I was greatly disappointed by this toilet sealer, as I thought it would forever eliminate my bathroom toilet leaks.  Well this morning, it is again leaking.  Did I do something incorrect?	1
It has to be installed at least 12-14 inches from the wall, they do not specify this anywhere. So this cannot be installed in a Porch light.This is useful only if you install it on a pole somewhere out in the openTotal waste of money!	1
This is another B&D blunder.  Motor drive extends tape but does not retract.  Battery door ill fitting.  Can see it falling out at any moment.  Not a serious tool for a contractor or weekend warrior.  Get a laser measure instead.	1
The cost for such a small item is the first and most important reason for my choice of rating.  Secondly the item is not up to the quality of product that serves.	1
read all the wonderful review on amazon about this ladder so thought i'd buy it - have to say yes it's a good built ladder and it's VERY heavy, which is my biggest bug bear just for little things around the house, outside i'm sure it's good but it's a mammoth to lug around i have to say.	1
On my old Camry. The &#34;compression&#34; idea to hold in place is not nearly as effective in holding drinks in place as say a factory default holder.	1
Would get the same results if I tied on an old sock to the dust chute.Quickly clogs and becomes ineffective. Use a Vac or dust collector instead.	1
They only thing I have plugged into this is a 200 watt block heater.  Every singe time the thermocube turns to on, it trips the GFI.  If I plug the heater directly in and skip the thermocube, the GFI does not trip, ever.  There is nothing else even on this circuit.Absolutely useless.	1
It just does not provide enought light to be used as an additional interior car light.	1
Just received this knife.  It jams very easily and the blade is hard to install.  Opening the handle to get at the stored blades is cumbersome as well.  Needless complexity.  I have to get a band aid now, gotta go!	1
I boutght this and the 12 inch. The Quick Connect sticks and the there is excessive wobble in bits when attached. Not for heavy duty work. Not sure if they want want you to use it, as it took forever to bust apart in pieces the the hard plastic packaging attached to it. Poorly thought out.	1
This product did not work for me.  I obviously did not get a good fit, or the product wasn't what I thought it was.	1
This broke within a few weeks of using it. Dont buy it. It's a waste of money. Believe me I know	1
I could not get mine to turn on no matter which way batteries were installed. It would not fit my M&P rail, and where is the on and off switch? I wish I didnt sell my other light the day of receiving this one. I saw the awesome reviews but am in no way impressed,	1
This thing is terribly underpowered.  Used it for about 1 minute, and taking it back to Home Depot tomorrow.  I forgot that I had a dremel Multi Max, whipped that thing out and finished the job I started.  The dremel is honestly 5x stronger than this thing.  Don't waste time or money on this.	1
I am so tired of finding my favorite tools now being made in China! These pliers are sub-standard quality, poorly made, and just as expensive as the original USA made good ones! Look elsewhere...maybe you can find one MADE IN THE USA somewhere!	1
Got one of these, didn't work. The fins don't spring out when the lock is turned. It pulls right out of the hole.Got another one of these where the fins come out maybe 2 out of 15 tries. I usually stick with schlage hardware and I should have again this time.	1
I bought two of these Arms to make a current shower that would accommodate people that are petite . We installed one and it just snapped in half. The second one we did manage to get on with a lot of effort. Not worth spending the money as we will replace it. piece of crap. Do not buy.	1
I bought these in the hope the tools might be useful in spite of their very low price of about $12.  However, the cheap quality and poor finish make them nearly useless for the most basic things around the house or shop or car.I didn't even bother to return them.  Don't waste your money on this socket set.	1
The inside of the socket did not align with the outside sleeve.  There was a lot of interference and the socket disconnected from the grommets when I screwed the bulb in.	1
I feel I paid too much for this product.  It seems very flimsy. I think I could have gotten a much better bang for my buck with a different step stool.	1
I bight four of these from amazon. Three worked for two months, plugged in; one of them worked only only for three days.	1
I tried to remove a bulb, but it just twisted around on the bulb.  So I waited an hour and tried it again, thinking maybe the water I put on the suction cup was making it slip, but no...that wasn't it...it just doesn't work.	1
I have tried this product several times and it has yet to function has advertised.  IMO it is a ripoff.  Just yesterday I thought it had gained my respect when it beeped atop a breaker during the second pass.  This tool is dyslectic because the breaker was located on the opposite side of the panel lower down.	1
Sent it back to amazon for a refund.  Cheap.  The switch is what broke and couldn't turn it on/off.	1
the glue would not come out of the bottleI think it was old or had been frozenbe aware	1
HEAD DOSE NOT STAND UP TO USE. HOLES AND DEFORMED PLASTIC AFTER RELATIVLY LIGHT USE. ORDERED RAWHIDE HAMMER FROM EBAY TO REPLACE. EHH	1
As if all the other reviews weren't enough, this thing is garbage.  Put the battery in, it indicated power, but none of the status lights came up, and that was on a cable I knew to be functional.Save yourself a couple bucks, and a waste of time and don't buy this.	1
bought this 2 weeks ago, based on my EXCELLENT  experience with Maglites,  BUT  this one does not live up to Maglite  quality.UNLIKE  the Mini Mag it is fashioned after, Maglite must have changed something  as the rotary on/off switch died after 2 weeks.  Guess I'll try the competition.......	1
Very expensive and just equally as worthless. Very bad performance. Before i returned it i made so many holes in places where the should have been. It happened just because the readings are very misleading and very poor performance of sensor. Don't waste your money	1
These didn't slide smooth on carpet and damaged my solid flooring.  They are flimsy and cheap.  I had better luck putting a towel underneath what I was moving and it slide easier.	1
This does not fit a standard four inch pipe you buy at your hardware store or in fact any store. Only flexable tubing. That can be really pricey getting a decent quality to hold up for an entire shop. I'd recommend getting regular elbows locally if you don't want to use boatload of duck tape	1
where is the 9th piece? look at the picture and it shows eight. i dont see why they advertise nine, and sell it as nine. does anybody count? 6$ is good price though	1
I threw it away when I took it out of the package.  I would be ashamed for anyone to see it it looked so cheap.	1
Don't waste you money.  You can't see the light.  It was not worth going through thtrouble of returning it so I gave it to kid to play	1
Cheap piece of crap. I put mine outside with a &#34;free, take it it's yours&#34; sticker on it. Buy a better drill. This is not worth the money.	1
I should have known better as several reviewers mentioned the same problem, but I tried it anyway.  My package arrived completely busted within the shipping box, with all nails ripped from their strips.  I used it anyway, only because I needed it that day.  Next time, I'll go to Lowes.	1
I'm very disappointed that Amazon sent me a very used set.  Finger prints everywhere and dull with scratches on the handles.  Dirty oil/grease in the creases.  Can't give this as gift because it is used.	1
It looks really good, and the description is really great, but mine would not solder even tiny wires.  It just will not heat up enough to melt any solder, even with new batteries.  I cannot recommend this soldering to anyone.	1
I may have got a lemon.  This saw burns wood on any type of cut.  Replaced the blade with a Forrest Chopmaster but had same results.  Something is terribly wrong with this saw.	1
I bought this last month and attempted to use it last night to keep pipes from freezing. It didn't work in any outlet. The temperature was 28 degrees.  Wasted my money.	1
I have very good & sensative hearing. I bought 2 of these. However, I had this next to my bed & did not hear it alarm. In my opinion it is to quiet. Its great feature of the light is a plus. However, hard of hearing or deep sleepers would not hear this alarming. Items were returned.	1
I had a 3 ft over hang about 2 feet above it PLENTY of sun light reflecting every where but it wouldn't shut off with the sun up.	1
I bought 2. And despite correctly aligning the polarized plugs on both, I had to use a vise or pliers to get them to fit the extension cords. And neither worked to flaah the bulbs.	1
Tested a few cables fine, but after maybe 15 wires, it won't even detect factory made cables as good. (multiple) Sure it's cheap, but it's total and complete crap as well. Avoid if your time means anything to you, and you don't want to wait for a new one.	1
Crappy stuff, or mine defected or it barely got anything sharpened,  it doss not cost 7 buck really cheap product.	1
My electrician, who installed whole house lighting said this was not 3 way compatible, although it clearly states it is in the description, and it seems others have had luck. Perhaps it was defective. Very disappointed since I wanted to use with my garage lights	1
I looked at this and decided not to use it.  I've kept it as a pattern and made my own out of 3/8 ply.Anyway, dado blades are set to different widths, you need different inserts for each width, and this is just one width, too wide for many uses.	1
just use a few times, cut some copper cable, blade damage little bit, two blades do not  slice very well.	1
took like 2 months to get them and more then half of them did not work. they were so badly made we ended up giving them to the kids to play with and bought better ones from walmart.	1
While the handles are very heavy, the interior components did not hold up well to water.  Both handles purchased handles coroded on the inside of the tank within one year.  We do have hard water, however you would think that this product should be able to hold up to a constant wet enviornment.	1
I have plaster walls and even with brackets and other heavy install items this goes flying off my wall with everything on it.  Was really hard to install on a plaster wall and after trying three or four different types of install screws nothing works.	1
I followed the instructions and tried several different types of knives.  Never could get any to sharpen at all.  Not happy with this product.	1
This didn't exactly work out as planned. It is so cheap looking that instead of fitting in with Edwardian decor, it actually detracts from it... No easy feat. As the saying goes, cheap is no bargain. Restoration Hardware or Rejuvenation are much better options.	1
Should have read the reviews. They do not stick and I would not buy again, recommend or even gift.  Bad purchase.	1
I can see this pulling nails fine but I bought it for end cutting and it's terrible at this. The blade is dull; dull in fact to the point that it's hardly even a blade at all. The casting of the tool is poor. The cutters don't close evenly, there is a large gap on one side.	1
I bought the Toto toilet & Toto seat along with this seal. The seal did not fit my plumbing/toilet connection. I did not use this seal. It is in the garage in the box.	1
Bought this hole puncher hoping to punch my leather belt, but turn out the puncher is not sharp to make the hole and my belt is ruin! Not recommended to people. Quality 1/10 rating!	1
I bought this as a final finish coat on fine furniture.  I have been using Boston Amber Polish.  This stuff, unlike the Boston Polish, left a white film that would not buff off.  I ended up having to scrub with mineral spirits and start over with Boston Polish, which I found on E-bay.	1
One of the screws was poorly constructed and well, didn't last long.  Unfortunately, it was the screw I needed to remove the back panel on my macbook pro.  I went out and purchased a new screw set.	1
This is a tool which was too heavy for me.  It is good for cutting wood, but the blade dulled quickly.  Replacement blades are very expensive.  It wasn't for me.	1
I knew as soon as got this that the only things that would be useful would be the push stick and block.  Buy it seperately.  Bench Dog makes a great featherboard that is well worth every penny.  It's what I ended up getting and have been using for three months know with absolutely no problems.	1
not completely straight. wobbles like mad. if you need this get it at local store so you can test it.	1
Cheap Chinese junk. Poorly made, low quality parts. One was DOA, one died after a few uses, and the third one is iffy.  Yea, they are cheap - and they show it. Not reliable in the least. I own several LED lights - these are the worst - period.	1
It performed great, shot thin laser beams of water at me (which I like), but the mounting is all plastic, and snapped broken after 6 months of being installed. Now I look like a wristcutter.	1
I now use exclusively 3M sandpaper after receiving a sample at a trade show, you have to use three Mirka sandpaper disc for every one 3M sandpaper disc.  I used to think sandpaper was sandpaper didn't make a bit of difference who manufactured it, I was wrong.	1
These do not work on vents that are on the wall, because they are cheap and flimsy and do not stay put.  They also warp from the heat.  What a waste of money	1
I understand brass fittings are far from sturdy and one must use little to no force in tightening this fixtures.  However, to have the threads arrive straight from the factory stripped is reediculous.  Simply a Waste.	1
Very disappointed that maglight would sell such a useless flashlight, even with a new battery it is so dim you can barely see it - don't wate you money.  Another reviewer mentioned the Photon Microlights, I'll try that instead	1
Would never purchase these again. These bulbs do save energy, because they burn out so quickly. They are not bright!	1
I tried these and honestly could not tell if they were on or not. The star light from windows on a moonless night does better. In fact the light from leds on my DVD player and computer did more. I don't understand why they have such abysmal light output.	1
I purchased this blade quite a while ago and have used it extensively for various cutting projects including different size pavers up to 2 1/2" thick and a concrete slab.  I am truly amazed how long this blade has lasted.	2
This is a great addition to my lathe drive centers. Its well balanced and grips wood with a firm steady hold.	2
This is a great invention.  Finally, something to keep the caulk tube from drying out, and they're reuseable.  I use them on my glue bottle too.	2
Am keeping this item because it can stretch and knock out larger nuts. it can also get the real small ones. It is 6 inches long and has a maximum radius of about 2.8 cm. does that help	2
Title says it all. A wonderful tool for the money spent. You can spend more, and I mean a lot more, but unless you need that super high quality steel?	2
This hose works great. It stretches and recoils easily. It's much more robust than the previous hoses I've purchased at local stores. I'm glad I found a coiled hose that I can live with.	2
this tool has not been used by me yet; but I used others; and they work great; careful dough; it is treted metal and it s fragil; do not pry with it;you'l snap it	2
You can grind to your hearts content, or when it finally wears out, whichever comes first. This is a grade A tool and like all Dremel tools it is built to work.	2
I am a home/DIY user of this tool. Its so smooth and easy to guide.I like the light which is on whenever the tool is plugged in - there is no switch for the light.	2
This is the most awesome, practical welding hammer I've every used. It is also the only I've ever used and it does exactly what it is intended to do. I'm not sure how to review a welding hammer but I guess I can say for the money it works fine.	2
I install a lot of entry doors and many are not bored for either the door latch, deadbolt or both. This set up has all it takes to install both	2
I am well pleased with the saw. It seems to be well constructed and has plenty of zip for cutting metal.	2
Used three packages to run phone cord from upstairs bedroom to downstairs family room computer.  Around walls, through closet, through wall, etc.  Looks great, very happy with it.	2
Delicious! Husband wanted pods to avoid coffee ground mess. We've used about 10 pods so far, always a good, fast , non-messy cup of coffee. Note though ... Out of the 10 pods, 2 were missing the coffee pods!!!	2
If you have a Reciprocation (Sawsall) saw, then you're going to need these!  Probably a LOT of these!  They work really good and for the price they last about as long as you'd hope.	2
Does what it is supposed to do.	2
Works as advertised with Schlage Link / Nexia Home Intelligence (I still don't like that name).This was the cheapest appliance module I could find, and it works perfectly.	2
This little sharpener is a great value for the cost and goes with me into the field to keep the knives sharp.  It's easy to use and is light weight.  Great purchase!	2
this was the cheapest 6&#34; hole saw set i saw.  dont know why anyone would give this less than 5 stars cause it does everything it is advertised to do and works well.	2
This is a great light.  It's super bright and easy to use.  The battery also lasts a long time.  I already owned one of these which I have mounted to a handgun, and I just bought a second one to mount on a rifle.  Very pleased with this light and highly recommend it.	2
A good bulb.I bought some because I lost my spare and I new Amazon carried them,so that was my first choice as it always is.	2
Had broken the tip off my 10 year old one so this  was much cheaper then buying a whole new tool.	2
Perfect for my needs. Moderate security, good quality. Accessing contents is easy with the push button combination. Not too heavy.	2
Some reviewers commented that the item did not come with the bolts to mount the saw, I am guessing Dewalt changed this and has added mounting hardware, the brackets are a must for their miter saw stands	2
Being a contractor, i use this little guy avery day. it tells me that the power is on and make our life easy.	2
This gauge works like a charm and easily moves from plank to plank. Well worth the money.	2
The Skil 2887-05(B2) 18-volt cordless drill is every bit as good as its Bosch counterpart, only much less expensive.  Both are manufactured by Bosch in China, and the Skill sells for about half the price of the Bosch. Compare these two excellent cordless drills and decide!	2
This appears to be good quality and I bought it to add to my kitchen toolbox, the price was right, has rubber handle grips, should be good for whatever I need it.	2
Good price for a set of drill bits. Ill be back if I need more bits. Like the holder too	2
I love this drill, it is a little heavy but strong as bull!You can't go wrong with a quality piece at a good price....no more junky ni-cad batteries too!RM	2
This battery was purchased as a replacement for a Black and Decker portable Drill with an original HPB12 NiCAd battery.  The battery was identical to the original as far as configuration, fit, and charging is concerned.  It has been recharged several times and has supplied power just as the original did.	2
This nail gun is absolutely amazing just like everything else Milwaukee sells. The gun works very well even on hard wood which would usually crack from the nail. Definitely a great deal on Amazon and shipping is quick.	2
I've burned through a couple of these installing wall outlets in plaster walls. Plaster dist will trash an electric saw, so this hand tool gets the job done.	2
Works great for drain cleaning. Handle is stiff enough to push through tight areas but flexible enough to make it around curves.	2
These are good blades. Quite unlike the poor quality Hollow Frate blades I bot. Once. Being that all blades are expendable. I will be buying more. These are still on my list.	2
Good value. Have 3 cars two Japanese and one German all have metric bolts. These sockets are very nicely made and have held up under pressure from impact wrenches.	2
I followed the advice of another user to buy this rather than the synthetic glock tool for removing the nut on the front sight.  for a few more bucks this tool will do the job for a long, long time and won't break easily.	2
Great for the gun range.Keep a pair in your range bag, vehicle and tool bag!Nice quality.	2
a good purchase of a strong and sturdy blade for all uses in my small handy man shop. so far has cut through all items I have needed and am pleased	2
This set is great for keeping misc cleaning items organized. I keep use it to store an umbrella too-the type that comes to a point fits right in the circular hole. The hooks are not deep, so do not expect to have many options for them.	2
Target card for use with laser measure in situations where surface is insufficiently reflective get a reading. Very well made.	2
I really like that it stays open until you press the button to retract.  So use to having to lock it open ever time I grab a tape.  Seems of good quality, cheap price even if it doesn't last forever.  Should have replaced my old one a long time ago.	2
These gloves are tough enough not to fall apart fast like most exam gloces but are nimble enough to work with	2
THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS MONEY CAN BUY.  THERE ARE SO MANY USES YOU CANT NAME THEM ALL BUT TRYING TO DRILL HOLES ON AN ANGLE IS TOUGH TO DO UNTIL NOW	2
i ordered this as a gift for my stepfather and he loved it, good and sturdy works great would recommend to friends and other family	2
This is a very nicely made imitation of the Sorby Steb Center.  I also own the larger 1" version, which I recommend as well.	2
The first one was smashed, beyond use. This one's in great shape. The little rubber feet are handy, helps keep it sturdy while you're working on stuff. I like it much better than what I was using before, wood. LOL	2
My dishwasher is old, but still works fine. The replacement racks are too expensive; so, I figured I'd try this and get a new dishwasher if it didn't work. However, it did the trick. It is easy to apply and I've washed a lot of dishes without any flaking, peeling or any problems.	2
Checked Lowe's the other day. About $7 for one box of these staples. So you get 4 boxes for far less this way. Since they work in my stapler, I have zero issues. Well, other than trying to figure out IF I'll ever run out now.I know, first world problems. lol	2
I really love this hard to find color and it is much more vibrant than picture.Rust-Oleum as we all know is a great quality and trusted product.	2
It's comfortable, adjustable, not pricey, and it looks pretty decent. Great buy.This is probably one of my shortest reviews.	2
I have and will use these bad boys for a long while. They are strong and just what i needed.	2
I got and never used it, but I'm happy to have it just in case. So go and buy it.	2
for your Aprilaire in-line humidifer. It stands up to hard water much better than the cheaper ones. You probably can get thru the whole season with just one.	2
Works well and seems like it will last a very long time if used for its purpose.  There was a strange warning about a toxic chemical used in its manufacturing process but whatev...	2
Super easy 2 or 3 wire install. Base mount to standard ceiling outlet box. Unit even comes with a battery and cleaning cover. Instructions cover functions and testing.  Purchased two at this very reasonable price, especially with Amazon Prime.	2
Upon receiving my product I gave it a thorough inspection as always and and found no damaged biscuits in any way, nor did the box have any damage to it in any way "Both shipping and product box".	2
Bought this for my son in law to help get his tools organized. Does that and more, looks to be almost bullet proof, right size and will be around long after  he steals all my tools!	2
Great for small jobs.  Be sure to sift your sand before blasting.  I used window screen and that was just fine.	2
This was an item one should not be without, I no longer have a workshop as I mover to a manufactured home yet needed a small vise to do the handyman stuff. Good quality, versatile yet strong and clamps parts very well	2
It's quick and easy for normal testing. It also works testing GFCI outlets. No batteries to wear out or anything and it seems a pretty simple device.	2
Good price, good product, fine service, what else is there?Good price, good product, fine service, what else is there?	2
This has been the best I have used.  It will outlast 3m by 2 to 1.  I highly recommend it.	2
It's a strong, durable key storage box that allows me to change the combination as often as I need to and it's very easy to do.  Mounting the box was easy too!	2
Good ol' Spic N Span. We've used it for years, and despite the new brands with fancy ads, Spic N Span remains a good all around, mufti perhaps cleaners.	2
This item works perfect for me keeping my hand unharmed during masonery projects, need to buy the whole set from stanley.	2
Knowing this type of Versapak Batteries is harder to find or not always avail at local hardware stores.  So glad Amazon has this avail right away and am happy to have 6 pack batteries in my hands.	2
Had enough power for my sanding needs and operated comfortably.  Unit has a well built, solid feel to it.  Ran it for a couple of hours and it didn't get too hot.  Typical DeWalt quality.	2
Does what it should. A decent price, good quality that is holding up so far, and most of all form fitting and breathable.	2
Ever put together a crib or some type of furniture where the hex screw is in an awkward location where you have to constantly remove and turn the screw. This baby calls your name. No more of that nonsense with this.	2
Simple to install on the wall easy to use and see what you have inside and the price is right!Maybe I will buy another one	2
This item worked great as a replacement cartridge on my faucet.  I had no idea these things go out so I bought 2.  It was a quick easy process to replace.  The hardest part was removing the old one.	2
Just what I ordered and it does what it's suppose to do. It cuts thin metal just don't try to cut 3/16 plate it's just not made for that.	2
You have to love DeWalt products--those bright yellow colors, easy to spot on store shelves, etc.  Just too bad they sold out to Chinese-based Black & Decker and are now just another piece of junk label, with no substance behind them.  However these blades are the &#34;cats' meow&#34;.  Best price for the best quality.	2
I have done a few electrical projects that this tester is the perfect solution to know what's hot or not. It's very convenient as you can operate it with one hand.	2
I did not purchase this one, because I wanted more blades, so I purchased the on that had two or three of each of the commonly used blades.  This is a good set if you are a once in a while user.	2
This is a cute little pair of pliers, smallest ones Chanel lock makes. I am a plumber and they have their purpose. Mainly tight areas or to keep around the house for home tools. Well made, you can never go wrong. Compliments any tool collection.	2
i absolutely love this thing.  it is so nice not having to take a bit out of the drill every time you need a different size.	2
Initially I was doubtful that the 83LM would replace my original Sears opener. But if you follow the enclosed directions and place it next to the opener (about 1' away), the 83LM will learn the opener's code automatically.  Works like a charm, but the effective distance is only about 30'.	2
I used this, along with the add-on adaptor, instead of installing a new flood light on my shed. Works great. Different time and sensitivity settings. No issues thus far. Be warned, though, THE MOTION SENSOR IS NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE. it's got a backing plate that screws on and the motion sensor is on a ball joint.	2
These are nice to have.  Never know what size you are going to need.  Can go from 1/2 to 1/4 pretty easily with these adapters	2
This lock is thin and easy to use, colorful too. It was also idiot-proof to set. It's perfect for the gym and a good weight.	2
It went together easily, it is solid and it fits the scroll saw footprint just right. The narrow back with only one leg makes it easier to maneuver around it in my small work area.	2
This is a well made product that fits the A/F & Oxygen sensors correctly and is easy to manuipulate with hand tools.It was too long to be used on 1 sensor, but that is Toyota's fault for not leaving any room near the sensor.	2
This is a handy set to have in any tool box. I like the fact that they included the Torx wrenches in the set.	2
I have used these a few times and they feel solid enough.  The finish is a little sloppy looking, but they seem like they will last for a long time.	2
I really like these hold down clamps. I use them in t-slots other than my Build-It jig and they work great. Fit and finish is excellent and it works well.Pat	2
I use these for repair on Endoscopic cameras and scopes. Quality German precision tools. Watch EBay for the canvas carry pouches and you can get them cheaper than anywhere else, and come out more than $20 better than if you bought the sets with them.	2
Water flow is very good. Fit and finish very good. The head angle is adjustable by a ball-joint type connection on the shower head. Comes with adapter so that it can be fitted to either of the two pipe standards for shower fixtures (one smaller, one larger).	2
It does what it is designed to do.We have a convection heater in my son's room.  This ensures that the room does not get too hot at night.  He used to have the coldest room in the house, now we know that he'll be comfortable.	2
Great for travel. Staying at hotel. Basic tool set. Corkscrew for wine bottles. Works awesome! Not much thicker than the old style swiss army knives with the addition of pliers.	2
I bought this for using a paint sprayer...hated the sprayer but fell in love with wearing this mask while painting!!!  I am sensitive to smells so this is amazing for all my diy projects.  It is super comfy and very easy to breath in.	2
This plunger is perfect for the low profile toilets.A plumber is going to cost $100.If you use this, you've got a 90% chance of clearing the pipes.Easily worth the money.	2
This is not the fanciest headlamp out there but I use it when I work on the house or doing mechanics on the cars. Its small size makes it convenient to work in space constraint areas and it is really bright.Hard to beat for the price.	2
As I do a fair amount of woodworking and sometimes need a dado cut in my work, I chose this item to accompany my new Bosch saw.	2
Very easy to install, fit my box well and controls my Fanimation propeller fan quite well.  No noise and also good quality feel to the unit.	2
It turns your rotary tool to a versatile work station. It is perfect for the ultimate model kit builder. it could become a drill press or a grinder depending on the job. It has many functions and you'll just love it.	2
Had been using regular tools for doing fine work on guitars with limited success. These were exactly what I needed. Small to work only small area and takes off a good amount of material per stroke.	2
These glasses fit over regular glasses which is really a big plus for use glass wearers. The price was right and the service was fast.	2
I used this on my new home-built table saw cross-cut sled.  The fit and adhesion was great.  Several months later I have seen no issues at all.  These are very clear and easy to read and fit inside the track like a glove.	2
