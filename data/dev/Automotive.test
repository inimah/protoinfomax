I ordered this for a 2008 Honda Civic.This valve will not screw into the oil pan, because the spot where the plug is located is recessed, and the valve can't turn in that space.	1
I read the directions fully before starting the work, followed them completely, and I ended up with a scratched lens after using the sandpaper.  I used plenty of liquid as well in case anyone thinks I put dry sand paper to a dry lens.  I would definitely not recommend using this product.	1
These were easy to break and they did not fit my 2008 Honda Civic.  The description of the product needs to be changed so people don't end up buying this and it doesn't fit their vehicle.	1
Terrible quality. These towels leave behind tons of lint and immediately began to become threadbare. After only a few months and limited use most of these towels are destroyed.	1
I order this core remover and got a cheap piece of junk. The one sent was silver and did not even have the non slip end on it.I NOTIFIED AMAZON on THIS ITEM.	1
I have used this product in (3) vehicles, (2) lawn mowers, (1) grass trimmer, (1) snowblower and a partridge in a pear tree. I haven't noticed any benefit in using this product whatsoever. For fuel storage, I would recommend STA-BIL 360.	1
I did not see any difference even after applying for long time. It may work better on older paints (but I doubt it). Does not even remove swirls, I was very attentive and applied for long time - no difference at all. Does nothing.I Do not recommend this one.	1
This is a well made water regulator but it restricts the water flow to much so there is hardly any pressure in the camper.  Basically, a waste of money IMHO.  Get one with a pressure gauge and that allows you to regulate the actual water pressure.	1
The crampbuster does not work as advertised for me. I need to keep adjusting it upward. I tried a piece of 200 grit sandpaper and roughed up the inside of the crampbuster, it did not work any better and I think I wasted my money on this one.	1
Bought this for my Subaru forester, the check said it would fit it didn't, wont waste my time sending back poor purchase	1
Leaves a sticky finish on my sofa, and does not protect against mild dew. I used Meguiar car leather cleaner and conditional, this really cleans my sofa well and doesn't leave a oily surface. Meguiar reduce the mild dew problem significantly.	1
I put one of these in my RV's porch light to replace the standard bulb and it melted. I checked the socket with a millimeter and the socket turned out to be fine. Not sure if it was just a bad unit or what, but I threw the other one away as I have no desire to have a fire.	1
I could not stand the smell of this. I threw it out after having it in my car for 5 minutes	1
I bought this stuff and it didn't clean anything off my chrome rims.  Worthless crap.  wouldn't mind getting my money back for this red bottle of goop.	1
This kit is impossible to use and is not worth the money. Regular vinyl stick decals are easier to apply. The fact that this kit comes with wet sand paper indicates that it is difficult to use and may cause damage to the paint surface.	1
I have washed these towels several times and I cannot get them to stop shedding like a dog. They are wonderfully soft, thick and plush but they just keep shedding fibers like mad.	1
Well At least Ive never heard that before but I will say it about this product. The jack was unabable to lift my car high enough for the 2 ton jacks reccomended along with this product. So unless you have a dam even driveway get a jack that can lift a little bit higher.	1
Okay, I didn't expect a lot, but I did expect it to inflate an automobile tire. Compressor would come on, but tire would totally deflate while running--same thing with trying to inflate a bicycle tire! I learned my final lesson with Slime. This was not my first faulty product from this manufacturer.	1
The product I received was different from the photo on-line.  Even different from the photo on the product box.  I sent it back to be replaced, and I got the same, wrong product.  I'm sure I could have made it work, but I don't like buying one item, and getting shipped something else, twice.	1
I ordered  6 of these  and  it didnt last, used them onmy new dodge ram 1500  and  it was  disappointing  on new Goodyear tires,  i went with Duplicolor Tire spray and  it last  soooo much ,longer	1
Once winter hit and the road salt got on the blades they began causing a LOT of smearing. I would highly recommend Rain-X Latitude but not this.	1
I do not know how bright they are because they did not fit any light assembly on the car! Uhg!	1
I wanted to like this but all it did was squeak and bounce across the glass and the car surface, leaving the water behind. It was useless.	1
For those who wants to purchase thi 45 degree turn stop. It will leak when there is a rush of waste water coming out. The seal from the hose can not handle this type of pressure. The 90 degree turn will works better as the waste water does not rush directly to the hose seal.	1
These Suck. I bought 2 of these for my car, and only one of them worked. The one that did work was blinding and made the vehicle look tacky.Would not recommend	1
I use this on the rubber trim on my old Mercedes. I live in South Carolina, so the intense heat and constant sunlight (I don't have a garage) does a number on exterior trim pieces. This stuff makes them look and feel like new. It's amazing. I'll try to remember to upload some pictures later.	2
Bought this to use with the torque app on my android device. It works great.  This is a lot more convenient to use than a standard scanner and can provide a lot more info when paired with an application like Torque.	2
This hose works great for getting fuel from the tank to the engine on the equipment it is installed on. I would recommend this to even my neighbor, it is that great.	2
one of my fave car washes.  its really thick and foams up nicely.  cleans the car with out stripping off wax so car doesn't have the dull appearance like with some other washes or dish soap.	2
I use this polish after using M105 on the car.  This product does a great job of finishing up the looks and making the car shine even more.	2
This hose is the cat's meow. It is rugged, very flexible, and it compacts nicely. It comes with everything you need to hook up to any sewage pipe. LOVE IT. MUST GET.	2
Great item for the money.  You do not have to spend upwards of two hundred dollars to determine what is malfunctioning with your car.  This item can do it for less than 30 dollars.  It sure helps to know what you need exactly when I enter a repair shop.  Thanks for an inexpensive and valuable tool.	2
This wheel brush is great for cleaning wheels. Go figure! But seriously... I was previously using a sponge and this is worlds better.	2
You can run diags in your iphone see whats up with your car alot of features for the price you can reset the codes after you make the repair it decodes the problem code and you can fix yourself saves you hundreds in repair bills also avoids you from being ripped off from garages since you know what is worng	2
It really helps to keep the car safe from water and sun. It's easy to apply, feels oily, and the water goes away easily.	2
works great for jacks so u don't starch or slide off the frame or where ever u put it plus it matches all my prothane parts on my truck	2
using it as illumination for a trailer license plate.  super bright.  way brighter than the similar style incandescents that have always been the norm.  im thinking about getting one or two for lighting around our 12v off grid cabin.  they would be plenty bright to light up a set of 5 or so stairs.	2
I really like these trims for my turn signals!  My jeep is Rock Lobster Red and trimmed in black, so these really made the front end pop!  Just clean your signal area really good as directed, remove the adhesive backing and insert and press, that is all there is to it!  Great look!	2
works great on tires,trim,bumpers and lights any plastic or rubber very slick and shiny,shiny,shiny stuff,your surveys are way to long.	2
I like these because they are thick, soft, have a long nap and short nap side, and are bigger than the Polishing Cloths.  I could remove the wax haze from the exterior of my full-size car with one towel without feeling I was driving the old wax into the new finish.	2
This tow ball is a great step up from the stock u-haul one i had. This adds +1500lb towing capacity and is a lot sturdier. Rock solid and nothing can get through this. Surprised at the price, should be more for how much of a tank it is. Great buy!	2
Performed a test out in a nearby parking lot with my camper. Once placed under the tire, the item never slipped when the camper was pulled up onto the item. They are wide enough not to be concerned about the tire slipping off the side of the item.	2
I've used these on several Honda products with good results. Of course one has no way to tell how well a cabin filter is working, so all I can judge by is visual quality and fit. On those measures, these are very nice.	2
Great thick cables to get the job done without fear of getting the cords too hot jump after jumps.  A great item to carry in any car or just to have around the house.	2
Bosch Clear advantage Beam  wiper Blade is an excellent product It excells in heavy wind and rain. I love it ! Also it is not noisey like my old blades.They are very easy to install. And  No annoying squeeks. I wish I had gotten them sooner !!	2
Finally got to use it on my and grandkids cars.  What a great tool, nice design, light and clamps easily on valve stems with no leaking.  Threw away my old useless pop-up stem indicator inflator.  This is the tool for my home garage...	2
Works flawlessly in every vehicles and ive tried it on big commercial trucks suvs and your every day work horse its a good deal and works like the other more expensive brands	2
Easy to use and keeps dirt off when it rains and sunshine off the tires! Looks good while protecting the tires!	2
These are lightweight and install easily.  They cover the wheels completely for sun protection to help preserve the rubber tires.  They fold up small so easy to carry in the RV too.	2
These things are bright. I bought three of em and they light up the night in my truck cab. The sticky side doesn't work on all materials but thats an easy fix	2
Aside from the confusing description, this is good stuff. The sweet is more like regular but the hot is magnificent. I suggest buying just the hot one, unless you need a regular paprika, too.Good quality product!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
If you want more energy, better nutrition and a tasty way to get them, sprinkle a tablespoon of hempseed on your cereal (cooked or raw) or salad, or add it to your juice, and be prepared for a new surge in energy!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought two of these for my crazy lab and sheepdog and they have worked perfectly over the past two years. Feels solid and sturdy unlike some of those cheapo ones out there that fail or fall apart. Price is good too - it is worth shelling out a few extra bucks and investing in a good leash.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Within 15 minutes my Boston terrier had removed the squeaker and basically destroyed the whole thing. I wouldn't recommend get a kong toy instead.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
As described... our Kitten loves the turbo scratcher!!! So the refills are a must! So it is nice to find them at a good price as well!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great phosphorus remover i put some in the top tier of my fluval 406 in a media bag and have noticed a significant reduction in my algae bloom in my planted tank with planted tank led light	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I use this for baking and the bag size combined with price and quickness of delivery is perfect.  If you want to bake yourself a sweet but feel guilt free, this is the way to go.  You use same amount of sugar that recipe calls for only calorie free.  No icky aftertaste from baking.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Fresh delicious dried mango. Soft good tasting mango. Zip lock package to keep them fresh. I like this brand from the Philippines.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Surely needed after buying the mini-mite that isn't.  Have 3 Dremels and 3 different fitting Collet sets...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I often use this brand in my Delonghi super automatic machine and it makes a great cup of coffee.  Recommended.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a really, really bright flashlight for being so small and lightweight. It holds it's charge for a long time. I would recommend to anyone. I bought this after I couldn't get replacement bulbs for my 35 year old flashlight. I hope this one lasts as long!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love the size of the package.  It is perfect for a party or office candy dish.  Good mix of flavors, too	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Huge snake, I tie it around my girl dog and she has fun, she has become attached to it and she takes it with her to bed some nights or at least I've waken up with it and her next to me lol	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
It is very hard to find Tassimo discs at local stores so it's either their website or Amazon to get these. At a little over $1 per latte, it is a delicious way to start the day and get my coffee fix.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
If you're training a Pet, you need their attention.  These treats are healthy for a puppy, grabs a puppies attention with the noticable scent of the treat, and are perfectly sized for a puppy's mouth.  Easy to tear to make one treat last a few exercises.I recommend these!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD

Easy way to make delicious brownies. I like that it came as a 4 pack for barely more money than the solo box. I would buy these again.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I give this to my 9 year old Rottie and it sure has helped.  She likes the flavor, much better than the wafers.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This tea not only tastes good but can be drunk any time of night or day. It is also good for a &#34;rocky&#34; tummy when anything else might upset you further. It is all natural, of course, with no artificial stuff added.  I buy it in large quantities so I won't run out.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
