There's this paper crunch sound inside it also. My cat hates it never laid on it, he stretches his arms and legs when I try to place him on it.	1
They don't fit the larger Friskies can. Not the single serving one but the one that looks more like dog food sized. Waste of money :(	1
... and killed my betta fish in his 5 gallon tank due to overnight failure cooling the water down quickly.	1
it says reall chicken but it is not. only few piece real chicken and rest of them by product. my cat was picking only chickens and did not eat others.	1
it does not spark his interest at all, the picture was misleading thought it was flashing lights not a ball....	1
I was expecting a gray mouse but got a yellow mouse that did not look anything like the picture. And then when I put in the batteries it did not work. It is not worth the price to go out of my way to return it but just to say I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!	1
this is not a fine enough grain litter for my kitty who ended up getting this litter stuck to his longer fur and even to the cute little fur tufts that stick out between his toes ... sure don't want him eating this!  I gave it away quickly to a person with a short-hair kitty.	1
Unlike the squeezz ball this was torn up within an hour of it being out of the box. Paid to much for this item for it to be destroyed same day!!	1
too tiny even for my 6 lb puppy. I didn't even take the chance of giving it to her.  Perhaps a larger size might have been better.	1
It is tough to review something that neither of the dogs will even begin to eat so for the critters running through my house gives it a paw down	1
Horrible lead. The clasp, where you pull it down with your thumb to hook to the dog collar, sliced my finger almost to the bone. The nylon part was good though, very nice feel to it. Turned out to be the most expensive lead I ever bought though.	1
We live in Florida, and this has completely stopped working for our dog. It makes no dent in her flea population at all. At one time it did the trick, but either the flea or the product has changed. Look elsewhere.	1
I bought this from petsmart for $50. It took about 2 weeks to get to my house - ridiculous. And it doesn't even work. No suction at all...Don't waist your money with this crap.	1
Disappointing, to say the least.  Loved the idea, but the execution is poor.  My dog took it apart immediately and had all the seams open in less than an hour.  He's not even an aggressive chewer.Needs to be much more durable.	1
One of my cats chewed this in have in a couple hours. Not durable at all if your cat is an aggressive player while under the influence of catnip..	1
It's not the best of quality.  I felt even for my 5# Chihuahua, it was still too small for her to lay down comfortably.  And I kept having to adjust/tighten the straps to keep it secure to the seat.  Like they say, you get what you pay for.	1
I have other KONG toys and thought I couldn't go wrong with this Braidz toy. My mistake. My corgi ripped off its limbs within a few hours. Not durable at all.	1
My dog is diabetic and is a very picky eater so that might be part of the problem right there. I set in front of him and usually he gobbles it up but not with these. Had kind of a strange smeel too but most of these dog vitamins do.Try something else!	1
I have a 67 pound rottie mix.  She destroyed this thing in a couple of minutes by pulling off the arms.  Now I keep finding the plastic squeaker inserts all over the place.	1
These treats came up under a search for "Made in the USA" they were NOT they are made in China and also treated with irradiation....not that any of that matters since ALL 3 bags were FULL of MOLD!! SO NASTY!! I called the company and they have yet to even call me back after my initial conversation with their receptionist.	1
I returned this immediately, because it was WAY too bright for my 2 gallon tank. It scared my fish, Snowflake. I bought a new one, after I returned this one...the Finnex Might Ray 21 LED light, and it's perfect.	1
A friend of mine used one of these to train her dog and it worked for her.  It did not work for me.  When I used it on my dog it made him run away from the yard even faster.	1
Loved it for few minutes, I have a 10 lb. dog, she is tough with toys, however this one lasted about 10 min, immediately she tore the seam between the shoulder and neck, which means all the stuffing starts to come out and is no good. Was not put together well.	1
My birds, budgies, liked it while it lasted, but it didn't last very long.  It has small plastic parts, so there is no way it was meant to last long, but I was hoping for more than a week!	1
My cat plays with these a little bit but gets bored because it only lights up if I apply force to it. It only works for him if he slams it into the wall. Waste of money.	1
I try and play with is as much as I can. Its really cool to watch her play with it. Make sure you are working with treats your dogs really likes.	2
Best food on the market and he prefers it to other dry food choices.  No corn or gluten - tasty and healthy.  It is worth the extra cost.	2
I love this product and so does my kittie!  Just perfect and exactly what we were looking for!  Thank you!	2
I use the big dog ones for the large tablets and the small cat ones for the dog's 1/4th pill dose.  Works every time.	2
i would recommend to people my 5 cats take turns using it,i put it in front of my bedroom window so they can lay on it look out the window and get fresh air all at the same time	2
I have 8 cats , some eat this other like the other flavor.  They all love the moist tender centers!They all like the indoor flavor as well.	2
This pump runs very quiet and has lots of power.  i have a 100 gallon tank and its almost too strong for it.  i would recommend the wave timer that can be purchased along with it.  I have great current in my tank and the fish love it.	2
The toy is very sturdy but unfortunately my dog always rips out the stuffing for the  chipmunks.  He still plays with the un-stuffed chipmunks and  the log.	2
Umm, yummy, is what my dog says every time she gets one of these.  It's one of her favorite treats to eat.	2
This works and works quickly, Have a puppie who likes the living room carpet and this does the job, It is great, Will buy more if needed	2
I bought the KONG BINKY with the dry treats. She plays for a while but not real interested. Started putting peanut butter in and WOW!! What a great babysitter!!	2
I purchased this large bag by accident, thinking I was buying a smaller bag like I usually do.  However, it will last a long time and is kept fresh because of the design of the bag and the &#34;zip&#34; closure.  Even though I had made a mistake, it was well worth it!	2
works great.....i have used it for over a year and my dogs and cats never show any signs of fleas	2
My GSD loves playing with this! I put her kibble in it and she goes crazy for it and goes after it for 15 minutes or more sometimes!Very happy with it!	2
I got this for my dogs, dog food and it holds a full bag. It works great for it. The upper part I use for storage of other stuff.	2
Well, all of my babies love this food.  They are sometimes a bit picky, but this food was a sure fire hit!  It is in pate form, but you can see the veggies.	2
All three of our fenlines love this flavor of Friskies......and our bulldog even begs for a taste.  It's a winner all around.	2
Does not replace regular maintenance and water changes, but is a quick way to help ensure water stays healthy for my turtles.	2
I love this bowl. It is quiet, and no water splashes out like the raindrop design. It is definitely large, but still need to clean it every 2nd or 3rd day because of slime. It stays cleaner than plastic.	2
My dogs really loves these but they are a bit smelly. I didn't realize what these really were until recently.	2
Not only did my Kiki like this toy but so did my three dogs. I would find the dogs playing with it and had to take it away from them many times.	2
This product smells great without being overwhelming. It soothes my dog's itchy winter skin and makes his coat feel amazing. He's never been softer or shinier!	2
I purchased this for the dog igloo that I bought for my sisters dogs at Christmas.  This really helps them stay warm.The item was received very quickly and in perfect condition.  Great product, great service.	2
This works great. It's simple to clean, and fits easily in a standard size bowl. Not pictured is the &#34;Omega Paw&#34; logo that's stamped into the ball, it makes it harder to clean, but it totally does the job.	2
I still use these as my dog is not 100% outdoor potty trained. They work well and are super absorbent.	2
this is a healthy, delicious and useful product, the only regret is the plastic packaging but the product is nice. Hope you like it	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water.In this case Flavored with Strawberries and Watermelon.I imagine it's better for you than plain soda.I really found it tasty yet not overpowering in it's flavor as some of the other flavors.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Yuban---ummmmmmmmmm tasty-good-smooth-delicious-  coffee of choice among many others that I continue to favor! Beats the grocery store price every time!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Fits easily over the hook of my M12000 Warn winch and is nicer than the red Warn handle.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I bought three other drivers before I settled with this product. The drill has great power with a light and two batteries that only take 30 minutes to charge. The carrying case is nice and holds everything including a pouch for bits or sockets. I only found one thing that they missed and that's a bit holder on the tool.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Perfect, this was so easy to program compared to my previous one, the copy function works well. I am just using this for heat as I do not have central AC yet...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This stuff is the BOMB. I have had 7 back surgeries and I am on very strong pain pills and muscle relaxers and you know what that will do to your bowels. This stuff helps so much and it taste very good. Buy as many as you can and eat as much as you can because these are so good!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
...whatever rice you are used to will pale in comparison...I like the idea of organic and being watered with glacial water...and...from the only organic country in the world to boot...great nutty flavor...remember...only 1.5 liquid to 1 of rice instead of the usual 2 to 1 of rice...enjoy...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Good stuff. I wish they would run a special on it though. I liked it. it is all i can find. locally i cannot find any cola syrup. but it tastes pretty good to me. i always wait until the price is right then i grab a few. i enjoy drinking it.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Dark and rich flavor.  I'm tried many, but prefer Tully's French Roast over all the others. I'm now on automatic delivery.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Good deal for all of the parts you get. Very handy for table top work!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great flour. Not an overwhelming coconut taste. I normally mix it with almond flour to make GF or paleo snacks. I keep 2 out and freeze the rest.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
What can I say except that this is the right tool for the job.  Bosch parts are best for Bosh tools.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
these are awesome baking cups, they are parchment, but designed to be non-stick.  They are unbleached, no nasty chlorine, no horrible chemicals.  Just an awesome baking cup!  I highly recommend them!  Anything I make in these does not stick at all!!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I purchased this item on the first of April, but should have read the reviews first. This combination square is a waste of money, I got what I paid for.Al, Conroe TX	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This DEWALT DW7441 Side and Outfeed Support  is really well made with heavy material. It truly helps when cutting materialon projects. Easily installed	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
DELICIOUS!  I eat McDougall soups almost every day for lunch, and everyone in my office remarks on how good they smell.  This one is nicely spiced, and even has raisins :)  Super convenient and healthy (no fats and low calories).  HIGHLY recommend.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I positively LOVE it.  No more having to deal with constantly adjusting the &#34;ON&#34; time throughout the year.  It comes on at dusk and goes off at the specified time.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The item is just as described.  It probably is not of the top of the line quality, but plenty sufficient for a casual hobbyist, and priced very reasonably	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have been trying to loose some baby weight, so instead of eating white rice, we switched to brown/wild. This blend is fantastic and a good price for what it is. I make it in a rice cooker on "semibrown" cycle, it comes out slightly chewy and delicious. Good packaging and fast shipping from Amazon, as always.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
