Cheaply made, and not very durable. This might work in a kitchen drawer for use in a pinch, but for daily work, NO WAY. Not to mention it is way too bulky to carry around in your pocket. There are better quality pen lights out there.	1
The specification section lists this as 500W max. When they arrived, the box said it was 300W max. Unfortunately, I bought 12 of them. It's amazing that Amazon still have not corrected this on their site! Wow.	1
I put this bulb into a fixture, turned on the light switch, and immediately heard a loud whining sound coming from the bulb. I'm taking it back and won't buy again.This is on a high-quality dimmer that works with Philips LED bulbs just fine.	1
Sprung a leak after the second day. I was cautious as i knew it was made of material, but got a hole it it after one use. Had to return for refund. Not sure if other brands are better, so i just went with an old fashioned hard hose instead.	1
It was great for about a month and then it would not turn off and since it is battery operated it died.  So I replaced the batteries hoping it was just a low battery problem but no the sensor is not working (I guess) because it just stays on unless turned off.	1
Brought this thermostat for a 2gig alarm system, arrived DOA.  Also be aware that this unit requires power to be supplied from your AC system 24v AC and does not have a battery option.  Ended up buying the 2gig CT100	1
These are quite bright... but not weatherproof.  Mine went dead within 6 months, filled with water.  If there were a weatherproof version of these that did not take on water, I'd buy again.	1
Shame on anybody who buys this garbage.  He is the president of our country.  For you to show such terrible disrespect indicates that you dont have any self respect.	1
the instructions show one thing, the screens mentioned do not existcannot be programmed by mere humansavoid at all costs	1
Crappy made. Had to bend it and do some hammering to get it together. Wouldn't buy another. I'd invest more money next time. You get what you pay for and won't do that again.	1
I was not happy with this at all.  Not a good BR30 replacement.  I think someone can come up with something better.	1
I'm not sure if these were produced square, damaged in shipping, or just never fit the bill.  I find them to be far from what's advertised as a &#34;machinist square&#34;	1
does not work too good, needs a huge box, which I had, but even after adjusting it for an hour, the front plate would not sit well, resulting in the clips not working on the doors, had to return it	1
Buyer needs to be aware that this platform will not work on two piece extension ladder. The ad's ladders described as model M do not explain they are one piece multishape ladders. Ad does say it is for stepladders, however, which in most cases have their own platform.I would have appreciated an advisory of this platform's limitations.	1
I got 12 of the lights I just got them hook up two weeks ago and did a real good job to, here I am looking at the lights at night one goies out next night two more go out so now I am down to six light left, yep they suck they suck don't buy don't do it	1
The battery compartment needs redesigning.  Batteries won't stay in place, causing the LEDs not to come on untill readjustments are made with the battery cover.  And again, the lights can go out unexpectedly, requiring another batteries realignment.  It does not find the center of the stud as claimed.	1
This light claims to have a 30W bulb, however I would compare this light to a 10W LED Bulb and I know LEDs, don't buy this Flood Light.	1
Bought This And Tried The Sound Ohm And It Didnt Work So Then I Tried To Test A 12V Battery And Nothing Changed. It Was Junk Out Of Box.	1
This light would not work at all. I tried several pairs of batteries that I had already tried in a similar light and still this would not work. Returned it right away.	1
ordered this to pull some minor 'dings' on flat surfaces of my truck.  FORGET IT almost not enough suction to hold itself to the surface let alone do anything else. Save your money and get something else!!	1
Now I have to figure out how to get a refund from the manufacturer  since it's beyond amazon return, but I may try calling them.  This bulb started to blink after being outside in -6 degree F.  It's rated for -13.  Rather stark white too.	1
Doors will not close with these. Bought a four pack of soft closers at major hardware store and they all worked.	1
Just got my bulbs half of them do not dim and the other half flicker when you dim them. Poor quality I had high hopes based on the reviews I read	1
Just way to maliable to hold anything firmly. Metal bends with even slightest. Pressure making firm grip near impossible with these tweezers.  Get the stainless steel for better grip. The right angle tweezers used for gemstone. Is the best.	1
The flashlight broke off when I adjusted the light angle, just broke off!  So now I have a useless light, tripod is obviously cheaply made plastic or it wouldn't have broke.	1
if you got a tight spot and need a little more torqe, this is the tool for you i bought a hex socket set with this and they work well together i reccomend this tool	2
Works just fine, not the highest quality power strip I have used, but get's the job done.  It's actually a bit harder nowadays to find a basic power strip that has the low profile end.  This one fit the bill.	2
This right angle attachment holds the bits securely and turns quite smoothly, unlike another brand.  With a short bit, it can get into a small space.	2
I like this a lot, I bought it to adjust my saw blades but also use it on weird angles for building projects.  My only complaint is the use of a button battery, I'd really like it if they designed this to use a cr123.	2
I purchase this type of cord for my business. This medium duty cord is very durable and works great for extending power for my daughters television.	2
The extinguisher arrived much sooner than predicted. Saw trace amounts of what I believe to be the extinguishing powder just on the bottom of the extinguisher. I assume this is a byproduct of the manufacturing environment. The pressure-test indicator reads OK.	2
I bought these directly through Intermatic to be able to add another on/off cycle for my pool timer. They work perfectly and are heavy duty metal. Not easily bent or mishapen. Simply use the thumb screw to put them onto the time wheel and you are set. Great value with Prime shipping - check around on Amazon for multiple listings.	2
Good light. I like the two different modes. Works good I need to see how long the battery last. Fairly compact. I like the difference angles.	2
This product is absolutely pristine, and beautiful.  I haven't installed it yet, but have examined it closely in the box.  This would be a fine addition to any home.	2
This just what was needed for the kids to see what they have been missing.Outside they have it all to see from bugs to flowers.This is just great for the kids.	2
Good heavy duty extension cord. Same size wire as  your house wiring so no voltage loss. When you need something like this&#8230;you REALLY need it!  Would be great for wiring a portable  Generator to the house.  I'm glad I bought it.	2
Great little keyring. I use it primarily for the bottle opener, but I have used the prybar and screwdriver tool on several occasions when I was in a pinch.Seems very solid and durable, and I'm sure it will last for years to come.	2
Excellent quality. Nice color to go with stainless covers and anywhere you have stainless appliances (kitchen).	2
I purchased these to round out my Kreg Jig clamp arsenal.  You can never have too many clamps.  These make assembly go even faster!	2
Makes for clean lines, and you only have to replace one switch,  not the whole bank to toggle switches.  Good for the cost too.,	2
Bought this to check the noise levels of household things like appliances, power tools, mowers, etc.  Gives you a real education on how really noisy things are.  I like this little meter.  Even checked it against an industry standard calibrator, it's pretty accurate.	2
These are great for general dust, such as saw dust, yard work, etc.  I also have a P100 mask from 3M which is great.  For lighter duty these work well enough to not end up breathing stuff you dont need to without the added restriction of air.  Great price over the 2-pack sold in stores.	2
I needed a way to measure the up and down deflection of the control surfaces on an airplane and the Wixey did the job perfectly! With the control surface in trail, I could hit the &#34;zero&#34; button and then measure both the up and down deflection from that reference line.  I'm very pleased!	2
These little night lights are just what I needed for the hallways near the children's bedrooms. They give off a bright green light that easily illuminates a hallway, but not too bright. Perfect for when you wake up and don't want to blind yourself with the overhead lights.	2
Great for placing in a junk-drawer, kitchen or desk drawer, tool box etc. It is not designed to replace a complete workbench. Performed as advertised. I wouldn't mind having more than one, just in case.	2
Quality product.Easy to set up.No motorized switch to fail like on a Intermatic.I used Intermatic crap timers in my townhouse.  With a new home I decide to do it right the first time.Trust me.  By it 1x and never worry about it again.	2
Great for making long cuts without moving the item on a tablesaw.  Works well with one hand and gets the other hand out of the way.  Cool item!	2
Snapped it into a Leviton 2-Port wallplate no problem. Works fine.  It's a little difficult to screw the coaxial cable into the back of this.  May want to connect the cable prior to snapping it into the wall plate.  Otherwise no complaints.	2
I used this kit to make a table for my drill press and it was exactly what I needed. Very good quality and should last quite a long time.	2
This drill is for light use. It does small to medium load drilling. It will do for household fixes and is great since the battery lasts for months. The charging is fairly quick too.	2
Absolutely amazing. We bought this for our 66 pound hound who is a crazy strong puller and after the first use with the gentle leader my wife is able to walk the 2 dogs together without any hassle or concern. The collar itself is easy to use and adjust. Have had no issues with that.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My dogs love these stretch toys. They hold up real well when each of them take a side and play tug of war	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Every time I order, I can't wait for Emerils to come. It smells so good! Love it! Always comes just in the nick of time!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
i use this toy all the time for my dog ad he loves it. i will sometimes feed him his meals with it and it keeps him busy for a good 30-45 minutes.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Excellent popcorn. Cooks well in oil and in an air popper. Very few un-popped kernels per batch. Stored mine in air tight containers to keep out bugs and to prevent over drying that will hinder popping.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love that these are nut free and low in sugar.  I don't feel bad giving them to my kids!  They taste a bit nutty because of the sunflower seeds.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I love honey......and this was the best I had so far.  Love it in my coffee with a little cinnamon.  Thank you for your fast delivery & quality honey.  :)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Really  sharp but safe to cut fur around eyes and sensitive areas.  I groom my own dog and these are great!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Works faster than any scoop I have had, and almost makes box cleaning fun.  Aw, who am I kidding?  It makes it faster and that's all I want from a scoop.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
my cat LOVES it there... super comfy . it is HIS OWN private bed and area to play too :)super soft too :)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I having been buying this brand for years. My family just loves the kettle corn. Even though I do not eat popcorn and never have. I am still going to continue to purchase this Orville Redenbacher kettle corn. I recommend this product to all you popcorn lovers.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I foster for our local Humane Society. I also have 4 dogs of my own. Always needing pill pockets. Love the PB. Not as oily.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I've never seen our cats chow down on dry food like this before. It's grain-free which is very important and *without* by-products.  A very quality cat food which they think is tasty. Also, NO vomiting issues at all. Will continue to buy as part of their variety of quality foods.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
In the time I have been giving this to my Maltese, I can already see a big difference.  The ugly reddish-brown stains are fading and there are no new stains starting.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The smell and flavor are amazing!  It sampled it straight out of the jar.  That was a dangerously delicious idea.  It's my new favorite oil for pan frying, and when I get some on my hands while cooking, I just rub it into my skin.  Feels so smooth and supple.  :D	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
what would I do without amazon?? this is the only place where I can find all the keurig existing aND the price is great.the coffee tastes awsome, too bad it is limited.smells and tastes like very light coconut in coffee.good buy	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
We have three labradoodles and live in WA state. So, we know a thing or two about wet dogs. These towels are beyond amazing! Not only are they super absorbent, but they dry quickly too. A must have for anyone who has to deal with wet pooches. I never knew I could be so thrilled over a towel :)	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Ive become so addicted to these. I never used to like oatmeal but these are so good! The portion is just right and they're easy to cook,, just pop in microwave. Amazon is cheaper than store and since I eat one every day buying by the case works out great for me.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Not a bad little bowl..they do mean shallow..maybe 1" from rim to the bottom..very heavy duty and a little care, it should last a long time...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
my cats just love this scratch surface and it keeps them from wanting to scratch the carpet and furniture. The pads seem to last for a long time.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
