Battery test lights quit working after after two or three times using it.Don't waste your $$	1
i tried it on a superficial scratch, and kept rubbing the product several times, and reapplied 3 time and scratch is stil there, i tried it with foam pad, microfiber pad, microfiber towel, worst product meguairs produce.	1
Don't buy this rear wiper for a 1st generation xB, it will NOT fit! Get OEM or a wiper from elsewhere!	1
Amazon really needs to check some of their cross reference charts. This does not it a 2011 Kia LX Sorento.	1
This item includes (2) very small pieces of sandpaper of different coarseness (It would be nice if they were labeled), (2) small tubes of polishing compound and (2) small polishing cloths. In my opinion, it&#8217;s not worth the price.	1
T.he website assured me this was a correct part for my model and year of honda.  Well the sensor was right, but the connector was female rather than the needed male connector.  The vendor needs to update his specs.  The part was almost right, but completely wrong.	1
I have been using the liquid blue stuff for 4 years and never had a problem until trying these blue packets. Now I had to call out a pluber because the toilet paper was not breaking down. Don't waste your money on this stuff!!!!!!!!!!!! And by the way amazon won;t let you return it either!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Probably a good filter but didn't fit the application. Amazon made it right, but be sure this fits your car before buying.	1
Be careful using this.  It slipped off my jack while lifting the car causing the jack to dent the undercarriage.	1
2 of these were purchased and one arrived damaged. However, they were so flimsy that I decided these were not the solution to placing some sort of grille on the RV screen doors. Whoever makes these should be ashamed because it is a rip off and Amazon should not sell them!	1
When these are attached to the lynx levelling blocks the instant you hit it it pops off the block it's attached to.  So I guess it does let you know when you're on the blocks, but it's not confidence inspiring at all.  Now sitting in the garage ignored.	1
I would not recommend to buy this at all. It is very slippery and not useful for holding the jack in place. I do not know why they would sale such unsafe product. Lawyer should make a case out of this product.	1
I've sent back two of these and both have failed. Talk about cheap junk don't waist your money. I now own a Genius G3500 3.5amp and it kicks big time butt.	1
Looks cheap.  The hooks sit out too far, so I don't feel comfortable leaving them hanging in the car...I don't want someone to accidentally snag themselves or hit their face on this in the back seat...especially with a child in the back.	1
This didn't do what I need it to which was to remove glue from my paint car. I even heated the remnants of glue and still didn't work. I'm disappointed.	1
I used this product on the rear of my disc brake calibers and it was a big wasted of time.Did not push in the piston.I had to use a 6in. C-CLAMP which worked out pretty well.Lisle Disc Brake Pad Spreader LIS-24400	1
no sure if this was a good buy , it went dead after sitting a week , recharged it up and it worked fine , need to see how long it holds a charge , i charged it work a week before i install it into bike  charged with a batterytender	1
dont buy this product, I  bought it for my 2010 toyota corolla because you need a special tool for the oil filter housing, the put where you insert the wrench into broke on the first turn, waste of money. at least amazon let me return it broken.	1
So I recommend this to clean your tires, but it will strip the wax coating off the rims and leave the  rims really dry......	1
Walmart sells it for $ 14.99. Amazon needs to drop the price to at least $ 14.99.Edit:Does what it says it does and does it well. 5 stars for the product itselfThanks to Amazon for adjusting the price to market conditions. 5 stars for the price also.	1
Cheap plastic that cracks easily and a waste of time.Get something that costs more and made better.the end	1
Bad design...  The two doors that cover the  hose and charger cords are not hinged or tethered, can easily be misplaced. Battery has been overheating during charging and has melted the bottom of the unit.  LED indicators show low battery charge.I do not trust it.  I will keep it as long as the pump works.	1
it looks good and good quality however description was not clear, you will need to unscrew the guter and then drill and then put back.... i did not even try, I had one before that was snap on, much easier. this one i will not use it.sorry	1
This item shipped defective. Parts not covered with chrome are rusting. This is usually a good product, I have purchased the same product recently and did have any problem. I need to have these two plates replaced.	1
I replaced my Honda Fit horn with this disappointment. All the reviewers that said this is not loud were correct.It sounds like the stock horn. This was a waste of time and money.	1
Too light.  Flimsy and just about useless.  Great for new RV/Camper owners that are afraid they'll get their hands dirty while dumping their RV/Camper tanks.  They don't fit well, slide around on your hands.	1
It was way too small for an adult head.  After testing it a couple of times, I started getting dizzy and not sure whether it was the fumes I was smelling when the mask was tight close to my nose. Anyway, I simple cannot rate this any higher not because of the small size but more about the odor/fumes.	1
I took a flier on this after reading the reviews. I lost. The meter is easily 5-9 volts off (tested with my multimeter and confirmed with my volt meter app on my power supply).Don't waste your money. Amazon should seriously consider dropping this item from its website.	1
I have a 750 Honda Shadow and this will not fit over the disk brakes. It was too cheap to hassle with the return.	1
STOP! Got this to take out the front side oxygen sensors on my 2002 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor P71. It does NOT fit, no way, no how! Get a 7/8" combo wrench or one of those fancy pants combo wrenches with the split socket at one end! My sensors weren't even that tight!	1
I must have misunderstood how this siphon works. I have never been able to get it work at all. I have tried every possible method  and no luck. I understand how gravity works but apparently this device doesn't. If you get it to work, more power to you.	1
I have not read anyones reviews, but I can tell you I bought a dozen of these, what a waste I ised them on aluminum, plastic and chrome rims, and the brake dust does not disolve, loosen etc...water and scrubbing works better. Find another product.	1
Doesn't work worth a darn.  Regular wax works better than this product.  Very disappointed with Mequiar which I thought was a good brand.  I will go back to Turtle products from now on.	1
If your thinking about getting this device take a look at the Camco screen door cross bar instead.This is a pain in the **s to install and wears quite easily	1
I was expecting a solid rubber-like product. It looks and feels like moulded plastic. Seems to do the job though, and it's very light-weight.Update - Changed my mind. Forgot they were in place and rolled my trailer right over the top of them. Crushed them flat. Worthless, in my opinion.	1
My petite wife, stands at 5'3", in her 50s, cut through the top portion (the "hardened steel") portion of the lock in 75 minutes with a HAND SAW blade.  Imagine what a power tool would have done through this lock.I can't recommend it.	1
Purchased a set of these to replace originals in my 2010 SUV. Absolutely no difference in brightness. One of the worst investments I ever made. Don't waste your money. Having someone walk in front of you with a lit candle would be just as good.	1
All it does is scrape and pit your battery terminals - I really don't see the point of getting this tool. Scotch-Brite sponge would work better to clean the battery terminals.	1
Very cheap blade, mine started chattering in 1 week and I returned them. Buy a quality Motorcraft (or similar blade) Amazon has the best customer service and took them back...	1
Try unit out when I first bought it. Everything seem ok. Did not use for a month and then when I try it again, background light no longer works. Only used it once prior to light burning out. Too late to return unit with incurring shipping cost.	1
I've used it a few times now on problems areas on the car and it has no effect.  I will try something else from a different brand.	1
Like other reviewers, I found that the nozzle spins or not, as it chooses. I tested it three different times, and it only spun one of those times. Obviously, this is something you can't easily detect or fix once the unit is installed.Back to Amazon. I'll use the wand-down-the-toilet until I find a product that works properly.	1
Difficult to apply and gooey.  Made a mess.  After I am done using this up I will be going back to my spray from Meguiar which is great and lasts.	1
The fender flares arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery date! The passenger side front fender has a flaw in it!  The side moldings do not fit flush against the fender flares?  The only positive is that the fenders where easy to install! I would not recommend this product to other!	1
I was looking for a nice towel and after read these reviews I was convinced to buy this product. Im disappointed because im Meguiars fans and I was sure that would be a nice product. Its does not abborb the water as announced.	1
So, I bought this after the tool said this would fit my car. Well, after some further research and trying to install it I found that it doesn't go in my car nor does my model even take a cabin filter.	1
These chrome caps would not work on my plate. The license plate screws heads were larger than the plastic rings that hold the caps. I ended up using them on my motorcycle. These caps were less money at my local Harley dealer too. I'd give them a pass next time.	1
the first time I used it out of the box, one stand's neck is broken. I decided this brand is the one I should avoid. And let my friend know it.	1
I really thought these blades would be awesome replacements for my OEM's, I was wrong. They do not form to the window and they leave streaks right in the eye line of the windshield. I'm definitely going to replace them soon, but will not be buying Rain X ever again.	1
Use a 6 gal plastic gas can. Been using mine for 8 years so far.	1
Do Not waste your money.  Bough a mid grade &#34;full size&#34; digital gauge and found this one to be off by 5lbs!	1
To thin. Ripped before the job was done. I tossed them and got a heavier glove. Don't waste your money.	1
This thing leaks on first use. The hoses are not tight and the brake fluids leak everywhere under my hood. Lucky I put 3 towels around the brake fluid tank because I knew this would happen. Will not buy this again.	1
Rubber is way to soft they all 4 tore within three days. Need to be made of neopreme or something stronger. won't buy again	1
Horrible material! I have to say that this was a total waste of money! I would not recommend this to my worst enemy (yes I would)!	1
very stringy and gets everywhere. it also stains everything it touches and did not seal as well as i had hopes, still have oil leak	1
This adapter works for certain functions, such as the brakes lights and turn signals.  It is missing the center pin ground needed for the running lights to work.  I purchased another manufacturer's unit elsewhere, and the system now works fine.  This is a cheap, inadequate part.	1
Although I consider myself reasonably, handy, I could never find a way to install this screen door closure kit on my Winnebago-Itasca motorhome.  None of the examples cited in the instructions would apply to my screen door.  Fortunately, I had less than six bucks invested, so it was no great loss to throw the kit away.	1
The tool worked great on the first set of pads. Went to do the other side and the threaded rod broke loose from the knob. NOT recommended.	1
would not stay in place. ever one who used it pushed it the wrong way & had to be reset each time it was used. better off with out it....	1
I bought this pump because the seller described it as a siphon pump and I wanted to drain the gas out of my boat's gas tank.What I got,was a gas pump that does not siphon gas.I guess it might work for filling a lawn mower from a gas can.It is cheap and worth about five dollars.	1
Didn't do anything for the scratches, no impact at all! Frankly, I am highly disappointed. Do not recommend you to buy and use this.	1
First of all, the cigarette lighter outlet just does not have enough amps to jump start a car's motor. Secondly, the plug was shattered upon arrival and render this battery cable unusable.	1
Did not fit my car's filter harness after Amazon's compatibility tool said it would, there was a 1.5&#34; gap compared to the OEM filter, I have a 2006 Honda Civic Si - steer clear of this if you own the same car	1
I won't recommend this product. I have a compressor for my car (12V) and I bought this. It dosen't work	1
Heavy grade plastic I just don't like how they look on my jeep took them out and took the loss. Live and learn	1
This chamois is very thin and will not last long.  I purchased same item two months ago and is falling apart. After purchasing again realized this chamois is too thin and will not hold up with repeated usage.	1
VERY CHEAP. LOCKING MECHANISM FELL OUT THE FIRST TIME I USED THIS CAP. PASS ON THIS ONE. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. WASTE OF MONEY.	1
Amazon said it fit a 2007 Honda Element, but the Element wiper arm is not a J hook. Amazon needs to fix their wizard; this makes me hesitant to purchase other auto parts from them.	1
Cheap and thin. Fit ok but was worried it would either rip in the wind or blow off the spare so I returned it. Painless return process from Amazon, 5 stars for that, anyway.	1
I have a full size sedan and this windshield cover was too small. It also tended to &#34;ride up&#34; the window and not keep the wipers covered.	1
I ordered based on product name, not size. Next time I'll order by size. Well made, but the connection is a littke weird.	1
Made in China poor quality item that does not befit the Robert Bosch brand at all.Not for winter for sure.The origin of the product should be stated at the product page.If I knew it were a MADE-IN-CHINA I would not have bought it.	1
fell off almost immediately ---  but it was cheap so no big loss...  only someone anal as me would think the small lic plate screws need covering :)	1
we bought this at canadian tire and within a year or so the tire gauge split lengthwise along the seam - making it useless - as the air just leaks out the side and doesn't measure the pressure... i give it one star for lack of durability (its not like we use it daily... so maybe 10 uses?)	1
this the first time that i received a package like this...the car wax container was busted and it was all over the box. i was really disappointed. i dont know what to expect next time. such a waste...	1
Filter is one of the best, price is one of the worst in the market.When you can get one of these for 5.38 at KMart why would you even want to buy it from amazon?I do not.	1
Does not make a noticable enough difference in sound quality to justify it's cost. I installed it inside of my doors using the roller and lots of elbow grease. All parts of the dynamat that I installed have good contact with the metal. I would return this but it is stuck to my car door...	1
I followed the instructions to the "T" on my '10 Wrangler. I let it dry 3-4 hours between three coats. The first time it rained, the "finish" spotted up, and looked terrible. VERY Disappointed.	1
Seemed like a good idea, but it leaked incessantly no matter how much I tightened even with Teflon tape on the threads.  I returned it.	1
With 50,000 miles, my factory ISS was making noise (like they all do).  I put this one in with a new green bearing, and it was maybe 50% better. Then after 2 months, it was noisier than the factory one I took out and threw away.  Now its REALLY loud.  This was a 100% waste of money.	1
I bought this because it comes up when searching for a Cadillac Eldorado 1994 but this blade is too curved.  It stands an inch above the window in the middle the whole way across.	1
I tried to be careful, so I enter my car information. Amazon fit checks show that it would fit 1996 Lexus LS400. I ordered and found out it didn't fit. My car has an arm that requires the thin side but this wiper blade is too big to fit.	1
yes, they are wire leads with alligator clips, so if that's your only standard for giving them a good rating...otherwise, trying to use these as jumper wires in electrical work is useless since they have so much resistance due to the very small gauge wire and shoddy connections. they make good clips for hanging paper, lol	1
After 200-300 miles i realized i had a leak from under my SV1000S. after investigation it was the o-ring that was dry rotted. no telling how long this thing sat on the shelf before it was sent to me. I guess this is a problem that could have happened when buying it from a local store but nonetheless frustrating	1
2000 BMW 323i 5 speed transmission went rought instead of SMOOTH as the product claim.I flushed it 2 months after and it was dark black and smelled like VERY OLD TRANSMISSION OIL.Refilled with Royal Purple.Dont like redline.	1
These will slip off and damage the clamp as well as skin your knuckles.Maybe if you were in a place with good access to the clamp it would work. I was despirate when I bought these and just wasted money	1
First time bike left in rain this cover leaked! Bike was soaking wet! Do not purchase this cover! I Just purchased the heavy duty one at twice the price will see how that one does.	1
Only the stand is aluminum.  The center shaft, handle, and top are steel.  Mine started to rust within a week of use.	1
I previously owned the cable luber that only  has 1 thumb screw.  Could never get that one to work.  I thought this one would do the trick.  I could not get this one to work as well.	1
My screen door is metal insert and this closure kit will not work to close it without major modifications. Cannot recommend. The manufacturer could be clearer as to where and how this works because I see a lot of RVs where I live where this type of device is useless and people waste money buying it.	1
Junk.  Watch the videos on Youtube.  It's effortless to get off.	1
terrible piece of item i have ever purchased.i threw away the product, and purchased a better product at walmart.	1
squeep-squeep-thunk.thunk-snack, thunk-snack.knock-whack, knock-whackkveetch-chit-chit-crunk-snitBut why belabor the point.  Worked well for about six months, then started smearing a little, and the noises got more interesting over time.  And intolerable.Back to Bosch for me.	1
Bosch has always been my wiper blade choice, until now. These blades just do not conform to the windshield. It's not on an unusual vehicle, just a plain old Dodge Dakota. They miss strips in both passes resulting in a messy windshield most of the time.	1
If u buy this unit, for your own sake, only use water clean up material, because you will be doin a lot of it.  Unlike my othe HVLP system I use for Urathanes and fine finish, this unit gets material  EVERYWHERE and mostly where you DON'T  WANT IT.........	1
I returned because it is just too much work to install and I find it hard to believe they would make much difference.	1
First time I zipped pants leg the zipper broke off right in my hand lol now that's quality. Buy something else!	1
To  costly abd doesn't work any better or easier  than a brush  anddetergent to clean the tires and rims.  WOULD  NOT  buy again.	1
save your money.  cheap plastic stuff that wont work.  it wont stay on the mirror it is supposed to attach to. falls off blows off.	1
A solid quality product well described and shown in the ad, nothing misleading, nothing hidden.  The cable is thick enough for the length and amperage, the connector tight and well formed, and the length was as stated.	2
I bought my truck used and it was missing the handle and bezel. The bezel is for looks only but it was so cheap I decided to get it. I worry that the handle will break but the bezel does not have any force being applied against it.	2
I have been using the Permatex anti-seize lubricant while changing the Spark Plugs and when it comes time to change, the plugs come off relatively easy.  Before I had to struggle to get them to turn.  Highly recommended for vehicle use.	2
I rated this product 5 stars for quality and ease of use. The scale is easy to read and moves easily and stays where it needs to be after reading the depth.	2
Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position.	2
It was easy to install and could feel the instant difference after the installation. No complaints very good product and I would recommend.	2
Good for 15,000 miles. I won't run mine that long, but it does give me the confidence to fun the full 7,500 miles suggested by Ford for my Focus ST.	2
Very simple to hook to drainage hose. Make sure the one end is secured to the sewer hose rinser and the other hooked into a sewer drain. Turn on the water and let the sewer hose get cleared out of any left over debris. This makes cleaning out the drainage hose easy and you stay dry while doing it.	2
works fine.  fuse is a 7.5v if that helps anyone.  i have 3 of these and they all work great.	2
It appears strong and sturdy.  More so than I was expecting.  Haven't used it yet, but can tell it will be very helpful to us.  That makes it a good value for the money.	2
Tri-Flow TF0021060 Superior Lubricant Drip Bottle- 6 ozDon't buy any other similar lube. This is still the best.Yep!	2
Works great on my 2012 Wrangler Sport. Heavy duty rubber that fits well in my hitch receiver and looks like it will last awhile.	2
It's a quick and easy way to have a battery hook up on your boat, motorcycle, four wheeler, golf cart, just about anything with a battery in it where you might could use a charger, or 12 volt outlet...WM	2
This hatch was for a spare tire crank down and was replaced because the old one yellowed and it was easier to replace instead of painting.	2
I use this thing on all my equipment  in the winter...as batteries get older and hold charge less efficiently, I use them in the summer too.  It certainly is nice just hopping on the equipment and having it start.	2
Came with the ends I required - I could not find these anywhere in Australia.  Well packaged and arrived on time.	2
Bought these as a direct replacement for my car almost 4 years ago, and they're still going strong.I just bought another set to change out that old set as preventative maintenance.  No problems at all.	2
grabbed this as an add-on.  Nice mitt, although it didn't feel like I thought it would.  Used it today, works great.  Would buy again.	2
This is easy to install and works great.  Now my grand children cannot push the screen out of the door.	2
Seems to work quite well. I plan to use it every 30k to clean my Subaru's MAF. Comes with a nice little red straw so that you can precisely aim the cleaner fluid onto the MAF.	2
Of course these were purchased to top the Lynx blocks. It helped from the blocks moving when the travel trailer was pulled up onto them.	2
These are the perfect size - thin and not too much surface area to make them bulky to store.  can't wait to use them!	2
It is exactly as it is advertised. It seems well built. If this is what you need just buy it.	2
Don't even bother to buy the ones sold at the dealerships, you'll pay as much as 3 times the amount and get less protection. Comes with very easy instructions that by pass owners manual instructions to save a lot of time.	2
Works very well, just remove your zirk fitting on your gun and have at it.Gets into those tight places, tie rod ends ball joints, etc.	2
I needed to get some brake dust off and decided to try Meguiar's All Wheel Cleaner. It worked, doing exactly what I needed to be done. And whatever it did not get, I just took a wheel brush and was able to get it all off with minimal effort. Great product.	2
I cleaned the throttle body on my 2006 Tacoma, 115,000 miles. The TB had so much carbon buildup and it was a little sluggish. The cleaner along with an old tooth brush and rag cleaned the TB to nice new shininess.	2
Very good product that works as advertised. Easy hookup, maintenance free operation, go-no go operation. LED indicators tells you if your set up is correctly polarized.	2
This penetrating solvent is easy to use and seems to work well.  I've used it to free up several rusted up bolts and such and, after giving it time to work, it has worked every time, so far.  :-)	2
This is a nice item to have in your tool chest / box. I use it whenever I assemble things which may need to be taken apart again. I even use it on my vehicle wheel lugs, with good results. I recommend this item.	2
It held up well on my 20 hr trip. It didnt rain but since its vinyl i expect it will hold up fine. Straps are secure and its spacious enough for like 5 luggage. Shipment was fast and product was as described. Hopefully i will have it for a long time!	2
This wax is great - no white junk on the black trim, easily applied and buffed.  I love the shine... wish it would last a little longer.  However, it does add 'pop'!!!	2
Nice fit and Stainless bolts. Nice security feature with the special Torx wrench provided. Won't rust in our harsh NY winters.	2
No issues and performed as intended, so 5 stars.  Not much more you can say about spark plugs, so excuse me for the short commentary.	2
This worked great for my uses.  I fixed my cars power window with just this.  No tools required, seriously, if you have a stuck window or slow window, try this first before replacing the regulator.I also used this on my home windows and they slide so much easier now.I also use this to lubricate my treadmill belt.	2
now if I could remember where I put it. I know ill find it and the put the key in it an put both in a tool bag in my jeep	2
Brake caliper is a moving part, at least for my truck.  Brake gets hot, soaked, and abused, and it needs high temp grease that stays put under the assault.  Recommendations from most people is to use grease specific to brake and crc name comes up often.	2
I installed this in my 30 year old Pick Up Truck transmission that had become hard to shift.  It was like putting in a new transmission.  Excellent quality and the lubricity is great.  I would buy this product again.	2
I am sure this will work fine next fall when I put the bikes to sleep for the winter. I borrowed a can of fogger from a friend of mine for this winter.	2
Its a tire gauge that is pretty basic to use. You insert the metal pin into the tire tread gap and the rear part tells you the depth. Walk around the vehicle and check all the tires. If the front tires are worn more than the rear, its time to rotate the front tires to the rear.	2
I have come to use this on all my spark plugs of all my cars. This is great for aluminum head motors that need special attention to heat expansion and removal. This is a big container so it lasts long and keeps well!	2
Does a great job at keeping the wheels chocked on all types of surfaces. Very pleased so far. A lot better than using 2x4's.	2
Used on a second hand tonneau cover, restored the black back to new looking.  It took a couple of applications, but worked well.  Also effective on other trim items, not necessarily only black.  It works like a clear polish that leaves no white residue.	2
This is a quick and easy upgrade from 55 watt lamps to these much brighter 130 watt bulbs. they are wall made and appear to be of higher quality than the Hella lamps that came with my fog lights.	2
The rubber is soft so my vehicle doors are protected from hitting the concrete wall. I used doubled sided adhesive tape and it holds it nice and tight. Great product!	2
Got this as this is a fix for a steering wheel clunk / vibration. This took 5 minutes to install and saved me hundreds! Can never go wrong with Dorman products!	2
Sea Foam is the best, My truck has 146,000 miles and was running rough. I used two bottles in two fill up in a row. Seems to have helped a lot, truck runs smoother gas mileage is better by 2+ mpg. you can find it a wal-mart for about 9.00 bottle. It worked for me!	2
I USE THIS ALMOST EVERYDAY - ESPECIALLY DURING THESE (15) DEGREE DAYS AND NIGHTS.  THEY WILL TAKE A TOLL ON YOUR BATTERIES.  GOOD PRICE AND FAST DELIVERY.  A+	2
Used to use the silicone grease that comes in a pressurized can, but got annoyed with the can losing its pressure and then having to throw away a partially-full can of grease.This tube will work much better. You may think &#34;oh, 3 oz isn't much&#34;, but a little goes a long way. This tube should last me for many years.	2
geat stuff i use it ones in a whie, really helps to clean the system, to be honest i do not notice the effect but the car run really smoth like brand new so cant be better	2
I bought it mainly to hold all the bolts, nuts, sockets that I lay around whenever I'm working on a car. Its magnets are very strong in holding the tray down and whatever metal parts you put on top it.Keep say much else about it as it does what it's suppose to do very well.	2
I actually bought one for each car and I am very pleased! It is easy to handle and read and needs no batteries like the ones thatpretend to be more accurate.	2
This is a good value. Cheaper than OEM. I assume they know how to make a filter, so that wasn't an issue. Being able to remove the filter without removing  anything else,,,priceless.	2
I used these two jack stands to hold a Nissan Maxima front end up and they worked without any issues. I will be testing the locking pins to see if they will hold the weight when the latch arm is pulled because I'm curious.	2
The stuff works really well, as long as the finish is free of contaminates .Keeps the vehicle looking showroom.You really don't get good results if you are using it over a vehicle with a dull, paint job !	2
Made well! Has a centering hole, for fast changing. Read my reviews for the best disk to use with it.  SW	2
These were used as leveling jack pads for my motor home. Very sturdy and keep th jacks from settling in loose soil. I'm having the jacks welded to the unit to save crawling on my hands and knees to adjust them but will still use these pads.	2
Rainy products have always served me well. As for their wipers, personally they're my wiper. They work especially well when used with Rainx glass treatment and Rainx windshield cleaner. I even use another excellent glass cleaner that has Rainx in it. All this makes for clean, bright and safe driving.	2
I got this nozzle to try a different nozzle for different reasons.  You can never have enough nozzles for hoses.  It works well, puts out great pressure and you feel like something is getting cleaned instead of just soaked.	2
I had a slow leak on my motorcycle tire where it had been plugged. I installed this Slime and rode it bout half a mile and checked it,no more leak. The best thing about this product is when you break down the tire to replace it is there not the mess with cleanup as with other products of this kind.	2
i like how short this terminal connector is, much shorter then other 7-way plugs i have seen.  the light are great to verify that you are getting power through the plug.	2
Cheap, but huge! Love it! I will never have a vehicle without these again! I highly recommend them. I'm watching The Rock right now. I had to type 20 words.	2
I bought this for my new car and my vintage car.  I don't like to use water on my old car.  This product works.  Like all products read the instructions before using.  Many reviewers write before they read the instructions.  I will buy again.	2
I bought this after reading all the reviews on amazon about it all i can say is they are right a very easy to use product that gives a great Finnish especially when you use it for a while gets better every time you use it	2
I needed a brass blade ice scraper for the cold Chicago-area winters. I tried using standard plastic scrapers, but they never worked anywhere near as well as a brass blade. I think the handle could be more substantial, but so far this Winter it's holding-up well.	2
First set of these high tech beauty's for me. I liked platinum plugs and these are supposed to be better. They look real nice out of the box.	2
Dries pretty quickly so you can get your work done fast. Easy to sand and mold to the contours of your work.	2
I got this to go along with my 12volt air compressor I got. I'll carry it in my atv in case I run across any situation that I may need it. It's heavy duty made so it shouldn't build up to much heat when in continuous use.	2
Came with separate acid.  Was easy to fill with no mess, although it takes several minutes.  Wait 30 min after, then charge it for a few hours, then let sit for a few hours and test voltage... if correct, install in the bike.  Not much else to say, it works.	2
I sometimes pull a car trailer and this adapter works fine.  I have not had any trouble with it making connections.	2
I own a number of Harbor Freight spotlights that take this size rectangular battery.  I've now replaced the original battery in two of my lights with this battery, and both new battery's work fine, put out a very bright light, hold a good charge, etc.	2
It is highly recommended in assembly of bicycles where ferrous and non-ferrous metals are often in contact.  Helps alleviate odd noises when pedaling too.	2
Perfect gear oil.Adds confidence knowing your have the best oil possible in your vehicle. Price was very fair and free shipping. Prime!	2
for my 06 Saturn Vue as this one wipes off of the glass and onto the rear stop light.  But it works well and I am satisfied.	2
I have been a fan of the Rain X blades, The latitude are new to me as I have always used the standard ones.  These work even better, they fit perfectly on my Audi that uses some new style clip, i was suprised that Rain X provided the additional clip to fit this application.	2
I've done new spark plugs three times now on our vehicles and the anti-seize comes in handy. I've also used it to lubricate the threads on a basic strut compressor.A 4oz bottle would have been fine. This 8oz bottle will last my lifetime.Just mix it before each use because you get separation in the lubricant (similar to natural peanut butter).	2
Used on all my cars, didn't work on my Porsche 944 because it's old and has a semi - mechanical air sensor..	2
This gas cap does an admirable job of both containing the fuel within the tank and venting off excess vapor pressure.It is brand new and AC Delco branded. It comes with a tether as shown in the picture. It is a perfect fit.Not much else to say about it.	2
this pad spreader worked on my silverado 3500 just as it was suppose to, and never got in a bind on time	2
This item arrived on time and in excellent shape.  I had 2 hoses connected together with a splice and this was a problem when using a dump station.  Now I can just connect them together when needed.	2
These small items keeps the water away from the side of the RV...This is an inexpensive great item = less work.	2
needed one of these.  great little hammer for hammering stuff. needed one of these.  great little hammer for hammering stuff.	2
Better than my stock horn. I have since then upgraded to a train horn however. It worked fine and I have used 2 of them on separate cars. No issues. Quality	2
My tow bar had the bracket welded on it, so it was easy to install. Really looks great, no more loose wires.	2
20W50 should really protect my bike and I love Mobil 1 oil for my cars, so this worked out fine...price wasn't even that bad	2
Good versatile product that's easy to set up for various vehicles.  Works well and is priced economically. This is the second one I've bought after giving the first one to my brother, a professional mechanic.	2
Eventually.  If the O2 sensor leaves mangled threads, this will clean them up without having to pull the manifold.  Great tool	2
Superstrong epoxy. I used this to repair a broken pot metal chassis of a Hot Wheels monster truck die cast car. The grey color of the JB Weld blended in nicely with the metal die cast chassis and the epoxy has held up nicely.	2
If you are looking to upgrade from sealed beam headlights to replaceable bulb halogen types, this is the way to go. Far more light is transferred to the road and ahead than before and with the same wattage bulbs.	2
goes on very easy and small can has alot in it. price average for the amount you get. when you wash at car wash make sure to forego the wax options, makes hard for wax to stick properly. instuctions are clear but small print. enjoy!	2
Great to have in the tool box. Cleaned up my battery posts and terminals quite nicely. Just buy it already!	2
Great price and better than most others I looked at. Rated at 6000  more than I need yet better to be safe than sorry.	2
ANYONE can do the programming with this remote to their vehicle.  It's very very simple.  I've only had it one day so I can't comment on durability but it's in the same shape as the original remote and works the same.  I give this an A+ so far.  Well worth it.	2
so far so good. i haven't pulled anything yet with this installed but it sure looks sturdy and nice hope it works as it should. i do like the fact that it has a dirt/water shield where you unlock it.	2
Fits my low clearance Mazda 5 that comes with alloy wheels and 3/4 inches of clearance between the inside of the tire and the suspension.  Have not tried it in the snow yet.	2
I love love love love love this product.  It has made it so much easier to do oil changes and oil filter changes.  The nut on the outside is fantastic.  I used it on my LExus IS300	2
You'd be hard pressed to find this product to be not functional.  It is fused and connects right to the battery.  All in all it works like it should and it is easy to install.	2
Good meter for the money, got this on a lightening deal. Its no Fluke but for basic trouble shooting its plenty good enough. I use it alot.	2
After comparing this to other products in the same or similar capacity, I bought it.  I've now used it three times without any issue whatsoever.  Very well made and I would recommend.	2
Solid connectors. You won't have any problems disconnecting that AC line. Some other plastic tools are flimsy and give too much when put to use. These are solid and get the job done.	2
