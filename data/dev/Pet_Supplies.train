Ordered this for my 18 month old dog. The squeaker fell out within 15 minutes and my dog began to disassemble the bone. She just chewed the life out of it while fetching; the covering peeled off and the bone ended up looking like it got holes put in it by a shotgun.	1
These may work. They may help my dog with pain. Too bad they smell so horrible that my dog won't eat them.The smell of chemicals is overpowering when you open the bottle. Good luck getting your dog to take these. You are better off with buffered aspirin shoved in a treat than wasting your money on this product.	1
This toy lasted approximately 15 minutes as my 7 month-old Wheaten bit down on it.  I do not recommend.	1
I sent it back as it was too slippery and my dog couldn't get traction. It was also too short to provide a gentle incline.	1
I was really excited to get this, but was disappointed.  It doesn't heat up! Despite moving around the heating pat, waiting for it to warm for hours, I couldn't tell a difference.  I'm sad because others seemed to really like it, but mine just didn't work.  This will be a return.  Disappointing!	1
I have tried everything to get my cat to use it. I have sprayed catnip on it. My cat perches on the top of it. She doesn't use it as a scratching post. It's a good product, but my cat doesn't know what to do with it.	1
I'm so disappointed in this product! DO NOT USE! It does not stop my dog from barking, it barely phases her. It stops her loud barks, but not her softer ones that she does more often. It stopped working after two weeks, so now, it does nothing.	1
Impossible to clean, you remove the top, everything comes apart. My hamsters escaped countless times, found myself having to duct tape parts of the cage they were escaping from. Plastic breaks all over the place, more duct tape. This is a poor excuse for a cage.	1
Would have returned this product but it came in as I was leaving for vacation and forgot about it until just now. Save your money and have a professional install a wall unit for your dog. A friend of mine did that. It is much more durable and looks great in the house. This was just very very cheap.	1
I returned this product since I didn't find out until it arrived that it cannot be located near large metal objects such as the refrigerator or stove.	1
this crate is tiny not even big enough to put a cat in,i bought two and could not return them but it would have cost more then i paid for them so sadly i stuck with two crates i cant use	1
Collar worked for a few days, dog stopped barking.  Seven days later, the device quit working.  "Made in China" should have been my first clue that this was not going to be a well made product.	1
My 1 year old Lab ripped this ball in less than 1 hour. It's in pieces now. Waste of my time and money.	1
I only bought this because I lacked a small amount to qualify for free shipping on an order. It is cheaply made and my small dog made short work of it.	1
Bought Chuckit ball and handle. I have Golden Retriever and after 10 days the ball cracked. It is a heavier ball for distance and thicker rubber ball under cover. It will split real easy after dog has it in mouth.I bought Kong Squeaker 3 inch ball works great!Save your money!	1
I was not happy with these. My dogs are small and only need to use it at night or if I go out for the day.But the pads do not hold the urine so not good.	1
this thing grew mold on it!!!!!!!!!!! wtf? i had to throw it in the trash just after a week of having it.	1
I purchased this to groom my cat based on reviews.  Looks ok, but every time try to use it, he runs away, not as gentle as I would have liked.  He is not use to being groomed.  I do better with a comb.  Can't recommend.	1
if you have an extended cab truck and want to use this don't buy it!!! I had to return it the hold downs ripped right off	1
My cat wouldn't touch Nutri-cal. The very strong fishy smell even turned my stomach. I wasted my money on two tubes that are of no use to me. If you cat needs extra calories, try baby food, the pure meat varieties.	1
I applied this to my 18 lb. Miniature Schnauzer and within 2 weeks I saw live fleas and ticks on him. Switched to K9 Advantix II and so far he's been clean after a month.	1
Not good, bulky and air only comes out certain sides, not all around. Like the long stick air stones better. This thing is heavier and takes up more bottom tank space than an elongated shape.	1
Although it clumps well,my cat objected to the smell. I introduced it gradually, but once litter was pure world's best, kitty pooped on the floor instead of in the litter. Switched back to clay and she was fine again.	1
Would not recommend it, dog destroyed toy on the first day.  Waste of money as far as I am concerned.	1
Within 3 Minutes my cat disconnected the entire wand from the mechanism. She was not interested in chasing the feather at all.She loves Cat Dancer, Laser toys and Fling-Ama-String.	1
Very unstable, moves around so much that my dog gets nervous. Not as sturdy or immobile as advertised. I am keeping for groceries, but not for dog.	1
The quality is not good. The little panel that opens to refill the hay doesn't stay in it's place.  Once my bunny eats the hay that sticks out, the rest of the hay is trapped inside and she can't get to it.  Not a good product at all.	1
I'm not sure this could have been made out of a cheaper plastic. Also, the clicking noise didn't always work. Returned promptly.	1
I knew this was a pricey toy but with such great reviews, I thought my 5 month old cat would enjoy bunny kicking this fish.  I was wrong.  She looks at it weirdly, sniffs it and moves on.  She's not interested at all and I think it's the smell that's turning her off.	1
The sound does not work well.  You really have to slam it hard to get it to work.  After 30 minutes my two little dogs had managed to not only open them but to rip them very easily.  Material is not really great for dogs.	1
I purchased this for my cats and at first they got a few minutes of play out of it, but other toys suit them much better. I wouldn't buy another one.	1
I'm editing my review - at first I thought it worked well, but within a week the fleas were actually worse than they were before. I won't be buying this product again. Very disappointing.	1
Have no idea if this works or not because neither cat (not at all picky cats) will touch it!  Even tried putting it in dry catnip for a few days!  No luck so I wasted my money!	1
It didn't work on our 9 year old Westie, but then nothing else does short of prescription medicines to fight a chronic yeast problem, and maybe food allergies. This stuff isn't &#34;magic&#34; .	1
Broke after a week of occasional use. It just stopped working even after we put new batteries in, we didn't drop it or spill anything on it. Maybe mine was defective? Either way, no more cat specific laser pointers for me, they're all cheap in my experience.	1
it arrived today, despite being a dull color my dog likes it. unfortunaltely an hour later one leg is gone. will the rest make till tomorrow or it fall apart. i was expecting for the price like this to be better quality than the toy from 99 cent store. I am very disappointed, Money well wasted!	1
I have a 2 year old Pomeranian; he destroyed this toy within 30 minutes. He did not want to toss and fetch; just wanted to chew and suck, stuffing everywhere!	1
This is the second box of this that we have purchased plus the powder and neither work. Our Yorkies have been eating their poop since 6 wks old and we have tried everything to stop it and their almost 8 months old.Waste of money	1
Cheaply made...one of the rings snapped and my dog almost ran away from me. Wouldnt accept a refund, pretty upset about it	1
I have a 9 month old puppy. She destroyed this in minutes. Would not recommend for heavy chewers. Better options out there.	1
My Lab easily chewed the little nubs off of this toy.  He loves it, but he cannot play with it anymore.  The description says it can withstand lots of chewing without discoloring or losing the flavor, but that doesn't really matter if the toy can be chewed apart!	1
This product was so flimsy and the glue trap was barely sticky enough to catch anything. Ended up throwing it away.	1
Well I ordered this hoping it would work. I've tried several new and rechargeable batteries and absolutely NOTHING happens. I just opened the box yesterday. It does NOTHING and really disappointed as I should get my money back.	1
it just does not work just use a scissor that works! this is not sharp at all and does not do any magic at all!	1
This is a cheap toy.Gracie had it torn apart in minutes.There is a squeaky round object in it,which could be a choking hazard for your dog,or a small child.This toy scared me for just that reason.Not reccomended.	1
Very disappointed in this toy... our wo dogs destroyed it within 5 minutes of having it.  We were watching them and they were playing with it when all of a sudden they had pieces coming off of it... very disappointed.	1
I do not recommend this food. It may taste good but I am not sure if it is even made in the USA. I wouldn't feed it to my cat. I know the dry food is too high in ash and magnesium so unless I hear otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this food.	1
If these were made in china, they killed my dog.  I don't remember the  name of the ones that did and please forgive me, Smokehouse company if I've got it wrong.  But PLEASE only buy made in USA foods for your animals	1
The one star is probably not fair because I have picky dogs. They would not eat this so I gave it to a friend and she said her dogs liked it as far as she could tell (they are not quite as picky). So - please be aware that the one star is only because of two picky Papillons!	1
Forget about this stuff. Most of you folks are too young to remember the "medicine show." A guy would sell a "cure all" to a gullible audience. Yep, cures all ailments A - Z.  This stuff, like the other crap for sale claiming to control/kill algaes, does not work. False advertising.	1
I use it in my 5 gallon betta tank and it is not too strong and it gets the job done. Very quiet and efficient.UPDATE: This was the perfect filter until it stopped working. I cannot find a similar filter for my 5 gallon tank which doesn't cause too much turbulence for my betta.	1
My dogs will not eat this, will be returning this w/ the other terat that is too smokey, too.  Cede	1
I thought I'd try this first without anything in it, just to see if my cats liked it.  They will eat anything that doesn't eat them first, so imagine my surprise that they wouldn't go near this.  Not much use if they don't like it.	1
This product has not helped my dog with her separation anxiety at all. I had faith, but it's been three weeks and there has been no change.	1
Huge biscuits. Not the best deal afterall, and even tho my dogs love them, they weren't easy to break in half and I think made them gain a little weight	1
This toy is very small, but it's the perfect size for my yorkie.  However, the stuffing started to show after only a couple of days.  This is the second Petstages toy that I've bought my puppy that's torn up after only a short time.  Won't be buying anymore.	1
my guinea pig hates it and she wouldn't touch it. I think i can only use it as bedding for her	1
Have an old PetSafe door - talked to company directly when this new one didn't work out.  Next one didn't work out either.  Finally got a generic replacement from Home depot for much less money - about $10.  We trimmed it a bit and it worked great.  Be very careful if you have a old door.	1
Our lab/G. shepherd mix had this bone in splinters in less than two weeks.  Her previous beef bone (don't know which brand, unfortunately) lasted for nearly a year and never splintered, simply got ground down.	1
they were okay but my cats broke them really easy and I was scared that they might eat the little bell	1
Unit was great until the motor died after six months.  A replacement motor from manufacturer costs more than the whole unit.	1
Pulls off easily from fabric covered couch....not good.Stuck together and adhered more to those passing by or accidentally touching tape than it did on my cats.Waste of time and money.Not a deterrent,not a barricade,not at all good at stopping your furniture from being shredded..I would give product zero stars if I could.	1
The picture is not what I received. The box I got is frontline but is from a different country. I figure that it is safe to use on my dog but I decided not to since the box is not the same.	1
again my cat wouldn 't eat this product;  no I will not consider buying this product again ; no more, sorry	1
Cheaply made. My cat liked it the one time it worked. If I still had the packaging, I would return this poorly made product. Also, putting in the battery requires a very small screwdriver which I did not have. The screw also came stripped so it was harder to open. Not pleased. Do not recommend.	1
Unfortunately, this spray did not work for our dog at all. He has always had itchy skin and scratched a lot. This did not to help relieve him. The smell wasn't bad at all and he didn't seem to mind it being put on him, but he would still scratch 5 minutes later.	1
None of my finches have touched this food.  However, I go through 1 feeding tube every 2 - 3 days with the mixed food brand, and I have 4 feeding tubes.	1
This product is dangerous to your pet's liver.Contains Tylosin.If you care about your pet STOP giving this stuff.If you don't just keep harming.	1
I would not purchase this product again.  The product was not thick but a little too runny for my taste.  it did have a good smell.	1
I was hopeful by reading reviews that this toy would last.  Our mastiff/pit mix was THRILLED when it came out of the box.  Unfortunately she had all of the arms off in less than 10 minutes.  Needless to say, not for heavy chewers : (	1
The ball-like nodes of this toy are perfect for the dogs to sink their teeth into and chew into bits in minutes.  Will not be buying again.	1
The pad is on front porch and does not seem to heat.  My cat chooses the old pad I bought several years ago and still  has a little warmth to it.  I did not contact the mfgrs. but should I guess.	1
Not worth the money , they leak after one pee pee. Costed me more than to just buy a cheap pad locally.,beside the time I spent cleaning away the pee stains!	1
Over the past 6 months since owning this, two of the rubber feet have fallen off, there is something rattling around inside of it, and now it makes a horrible noise. And that's all from sitting on a shelf and being left on.	1
Well, this was a disappointment.  I bought this food wanting good quality food formy dogs, but they will not eat it.	1
bought this to clean out my 10 gallon fish tank. once i got it to start sucking out the water it would stop and would have to take it apart to dig rocks out of the little flap at the top.	1
Not worth the money. The individual dishes are very small. Maybe if you have a cat this would work well but defiantly not for dogs.	1
Had trouble getting it to glow and gave up.  Wish there was more guidance about what kind of light it takes to make it bright.  Or maybe it just never does get very bright.	1
items are very cheap..and my cat wasn't at all interested in them..overpriced and overrated in other reviews..disapointing and too cheap to return for refund.	1
My ten pound something-or-other mix already bent most of the bars.... She gets her head stuck in between them trying th escape. It's not very safe at all anymore, not even a year old...	1
Found a flea on my cat as well as flea feces after he'd been wearing the collar for a few weeks. Very sad. I ended up using Advantage on him after all.	1
It yo have a parrot it will last about a week. I have a Sun Conure and he made short work of both of these. Right price thought, I suppose you "get what ya pay for". Amazon & seller did a great job as usual.	1
This is a replacement tube for the one that already comes with the product.  It cannot be use to "extend" the tube for a taller tank without restricting water flow, as the name implies.	1
It didn't work for my pups but I know they have lots of issues that may be better addressed through meds.	1
I sprayed a few things with this spray and my dog loves the taste.  She chews right on it.  She thinks it is a treat for her!	1
Worked pretty good for about a week, but my two dogs got used to it after that. They'll bark right in front of it, I'll see the little light going off showing that it's working but nothing.....they just keep on barking. I'll never buy another one.	1
The title says enough.  Mousse tried to escape, got stuck and suffocated to death. Do not Buy!  This is definitely a hazard!	1
I consider my Sheltie to be an intelligent dog, but the noise of the toy makes him back away. And I can't tell you how many times I've "demonstrated" how to get the kibble out. He just waits until I do it. He could care less about the thing, and he's very food motivated.	1
I believe when people say that it worked with their dog, but with my hyper dog, it did not work.	1
Wellness kitten brand cat food has been recalled twice.  It made my kitty sick both times and we had no idea it was the cat food.  I will never buy this product again.  The company did a poor job communicating the recall to its customers.  Our cat's thiamine level was affected.	1
waste of money, does not work. (for us, i have heard other people claim it worked for them) we had a cat peeing in the house, tried this, the cat still pees in the house. oh well.	1
It looks very cute but after washing twice and even leaving in the sun to dry it still had a weird chemical smell.	1
First of all, I ordered the &#34;large&#34; size thinking it would be well, somewhat &#34;large&#34;.... unless you have a toy purse dog this product is by FAR not large at all. I have a dog almost a year old who chew this apart in no joke 1 hour. Would not recommend for larger dogs. This is for toy dogs.	1
I know this was cheap, but don't waste your money by buying this.  It definitely didn't work for me.  It will get your pet's attention, at least once, but that's it.	1
My aggressive-chewer five month old lab ripped this toy apart in less than on hour. I was pretty disappointed in the quality.	1
I have four chinchillas & they will not eat this food, not even the treats in it. Also, it contains sunflower seeds which I've read in a lot of research that chinchillas should not have. Will donate it instead of returning - maybe a bunnies will like it.	1
My cats not interest in this thing at all. He likes food, loves snacks and string but this thing does absolutely nothing for him.Lastly, you get 2 cents worth of plastic and they charge $5.00 bucks for it?? I was duped.	1
I've used this for years with many cats.My most recent purchase is a new formula.  It's runny goop that the cats hate....I wasted money on several tubes.My search begins for another brand.....	1
I have 2 dogs. Neither of them is interested in this toy. They have a basket full of toys that they love using, and this one seems to be too hard/not interesting enough. Shame because they love playing tug of war with their other toys and I thought this would be ideal, but it's definitely a no-go.	1
Yes this device makes an ultrasound noise.What this means to the dog with depend on the dog's temperament and previous experience, and how you use it.I certainly would not rely on this device for self-defense against an aggressive dog.	1
My dog is a heavy chewer and usually starts destroying rope toys in minutes, but this one seems to be holding up pretty well.	2
My dog likes them and they are much cheaper than pet people, pet smart, petco, etc etc. Only place that may be able to compete price wise is costco. It smells but not to the extent that would make me want to leave the area.	2
My kitties love this thing so much! They were trying to play with it before it was even fully put together. And it's great because my older cat can sleep on the top while the younger kitten can play around in the bottom! Absolutely delighted to have bought this on an impulse!	2
My boxer likes these, but he doesn't get really excited about them.  But if they work as advertised and clean his teeth, then they are great.	2
I love this product, and so does my 7 month old puppy. She loves to run and chase the balls. Now if only I can her to bring them back to me.	2
I can only vouch for my dog ... he loves them and has had greenies for years	2
I use the Teafco Argo Airline Approved Aero Pet Carrier to haul my dead, stuffed, hamster when I fly. Using this product, I am allowed to transport my beloved hamster legally without any problems. I possess licensed taxidermist documents and I just board the plane.	2
We use this on the side of a glass critter cage for our hamster because the room he is in gets very cold in the winter. He made his nest right up against it and is much more active now that he is warmer. Nibbles says, &#34;Love it!&#34;	2
I've had great success with the Missing Link products.  My dogs like it and it shows in their health and also their coats.  We have used both the Missing Link Plus and the Missing Link Vegetarian Formulas for years.	2
use this when i change water in my tank and it is wonderful stuff.Recomend it as a great product for your tank.	2
amusing cats love to play with it	2
Hoping this new dog food will have amazing results with my dogs. I like the list of ingredients and they seem to like the taste.	2
This works perfectly on my long haired cat.  I tried the furminator, but it didn't do the job.  This works great and I love how it holds all of the fur instead of having it blow all over the place.	2
I searched all around for the cheapest Frontline Plus I could find. It works perfectly. Nothing's as bad as a flea infestation! This was the best price I could find.	2
I have five cats, so the litter boxes are a constant in my life!This product works very well.  Easy to scoop.,long-lasting with intermittent scoops and addition of new pellets. Good odor control.Highly recommend.	2
I have read all the reviews previous to purchase it and I can tell you that were true.This product works very much to its purpose. I have 2 dogs with ears problems and its helps so much to remove and clean them.Thank you all for recommended it.Now I am recommending it too.Excellent price, formula and customer service.I am very happy.	2
The dog and my Bengal cat both love these!  They have a strong smell that I don't like, but the critters love!	2
OH this is a ball favorite at our house!  All three of the dogs love this ball and will chase it for hours!	2
Used it just 3-4 times but its good stuff. It does what its supposed to & I like that. I would recommend it to anyone & everyone.	2
They fit easily and last a long time. When one side is worn out you can flip it over. Add a little cat nip and watch your kitties go crazy! It defintely prevents them from ripping up the furniture!	2
My healthy elderly cats have only eaten Purina Cat Chow for their whole lives and is the only dry food they willingly eat. It is very convenient to have Amazon deliver it to my front porch and the price is competitive.Highly Recommended!CFH	2
I have an Andis electric groomer for my 2 Bichons.  I require 3-4 different blades during the groom. When grooming is done, cleaning my blades with a little of this in a small rectangler bowl cleans them of all hair and debris.	2
I absolutely love this product. For the past 4-5 years it has worked wonders for my kitties. They are Persian and very fluffy and I would be in a big trouble with hairballs if it was not because of this great product. Highly recommended.	2
WOW I bought 3 of these bowls and I am so pleased with them. Thank you Amazon reviewers for your great recommendation.	2
All 3 of my dogs-pom, yorkie, rat terrier, love these. I just received my 2nd order. Wish these were on sub. and save.	2
I ordered two of these actually - one for food and one for water.  It's easy to take out and clean and put back.  Quick delivery too !	2
Moved to Florida and my dog immediately picked up an infestation of fleas...tons of them.  I used this in conjunction with CapstarNovartis Capstar Flea Treatment Blue Tabs for Dogs and Cats and completely control the flea issue.  Fleas and bugs are a very common problem in Florida, but with this combination, NO MORE FLEAS!!	2
Use these for indoor and outdoor play. These are her favorite toys. She chases and retrieves them, catches them on the fly and likes to play tug with them.	2
Once again I bought a toy that my picky Abyssinian didn't spend one minute playing with.  I gave it to my sister for her cats and they love it.  I even sprinkled some catnip inside the box to make it more enticing.	2
I like this brush because I can use it on the cat (who loves it) and I don't have to pay extra special attention to over- grooming her because the bristles are so soft. It's not the greatest brush for removing loose hair, but the cat loves it.	2
My dog really likes this bone and it's been very durable so far (3+ months). Plus it was a great price on Amazon.	2
I have a male Maine Coon and he fits through this door perfectly. We actually took off the door part. So the cats can just walk straight thru without having to push it open. We use this inside the house so they can get into the basement. Only problem is my 2 1/2 yr old can also squeeze thru.	2
Cotton Balz loves his greens.  Unfortunately he chooses to pull the seed pod out of his watering device and leave it on the floor.  Bad Cat!	2
Her dog de-squeaked all her toys. My Mom fixed them with these and now the dog can have all her toys squeak again. Took her a whole day to discover they all squeaked again and she is a happy puppy.	2
My two dogs love this Pup-peroni. Great treat and I like that it is 90% fat free. This size bag last us for a long time.	2
I use this for my dog who has really bad skin allergies during the summer. I bathe her 3 times a week and this has decreased the itching significantly.	2
These are great, I've bought many dog treats that my pups have enjoyed, but this is the only one I've been motivated to write a review about.	2
I have a dog that will surgically remove squeakers and stuffing, so this toy is great - it's lasted longer than expected and I can stuff other toys that are more durable inside for her to &#34;pull out&#34; which satisfies her need to tear other toys apart.	2
Excellent product for your tall tank.  Allows the filter to take in more debris.  Did exactly what I needed it to do.	2
Works great on a timer for the day time heating. So far the life expectancy is good, heats up area nicely.	2
I have a 70lb shepherd/heeler mix who is absolutely obsessed with these.  He will happily play with it for hours and then still picks it up and reinvestigates weeks later, especially if i push the flavored goo up a little so he can reach it. I'll be buying lots more of these.	2
Able to make the cage into what ever we wanted even through and around other items. love it would recommend.	2
My rescued Rottie loves it! It's his favorite toy. We tug it together while I squeak one side and he squeaks the other side. Really cute. For a large dog, he has not attempt to shred it. Good toy!	2
I have a catnip toy that is the favorite of my cat.  When I spray it on it works like it was new.	2
I spent much more on a tugga rope and I'm finding strings all over my house from it. This one has held together great w/out shedding strings.	2
this has made a dramatic impact on my dogs paw pads.  He had some minor rough areas near his nails but nothing severe.  After using this for about a month his pads are in perfect condition.  Absorbs well.  Not completely but its not getting everywhere either.  Happy with the product. This will last forever too!	2
Love it! But even better, my puppy loves it! Chews this instead of my shoes which has been a big help! He has had it for a month now and it is still going strong!	2
it was great, my dog got really exited and broke it before 5 mins had gone by, but it was fun	2
I had six shitzuh puppies at my house and was in desperate need of toys. the retail stores wanted way to much for these same type of toys. shipped quick and they loved it.	2
Was looking for an additional PetSafe heated bed and found out that some of them are being recalled, I called the 800 number and PetSafe is sending a new adaptor. The bed has functioned perfectly for over five years and is much loved by our cats and dog. The company and the product get 5-stars in my book.	2
And really that's all that matters right? The squeekers lasted longer than most and expect purple pieces of fabric and fur if your dog is a chewer but not more than any other!	2
this bulb does what you would expect it to do, plus amazon has a great price for now these things, might as well buy a spare while you are buying.	2
These filters were the exact ones that are sold in pet stores.  The price is half what I would normally pay, and best of all, these really do a good job in keeping my aquarium clean.	2
I have been using this for years, mixing it with my 3 cats regular food. After spending $300 on a teeth cleaning for 1 cat I figured there had to be something cheaper and easier than brushing their teeth. This cuts down on plaque TREMENDOUSLY and is $7 cheaper a bag than my pet store!	2
My dogs eat only this can dog food with dry good. They enjoy the texture, flavor n I find the vitamins n vegetables are great. Would take me all day to cook n get all these ingredients in they meals	2
This is my lab's second and final gentle lead (he outgrew the puppy size at 7 months!).  I highly recommend this product to every dog owner who wants to train their dog to walk WITH them and enjoy every moment of the walk.  No more tugging; struggling to get out; it's great!	2
Many things I've bought for my cats have an interest life of about 2 hours. Not so with this product!  I don't know if it's the sound of the material or the tunnel shape but my cats love this and have since I got it about two months ago.	2
can't beat the price , esp. with regularly scheduled shipping. also, comforting to know that my kitty will be eating organic and healthy!  it's nice to trust a company's product, in this market.	2
Phew....this is one great big rawhide! My dogs (both English Springe Spaniels) love these &#34;bones&#34;. Between the two of them they chewed one to the half-way point in one day....and these are rock hard! But as the novelty has worn off, they are gnawing away day after day.	2
The cats beg for their breakfast and dinner now. The 18yr old has put on some much needed weight while the youngest (and fattest) has lost some of his blubber. Both cats have shiny coats, energy to play, and less stink left in the litter box. Read the ingredients of what you feed your animals.	2
I've been using this pond food for several years and all my fish seem to enjoy these pellets. This is the only food I give them.	2
This is so well made.  It holds 12-15 lb bags of food, ( I leave the food in the bags)The treat box is big enough to keep biscuits and big bones.  It fits beautifully in my pantry.	2
This is potent stuff. Very few sticks, almost entirely buds and leaves. My cats react more to Sojos than any other brand.	2
my dog loved this . . . to death . . . the toys death, that is. but he chewed it for a month and i am satisfied with the use he and i got out of it (don't tell him that i chewed it after he went to sleep), for this price. i will buy another one.	2
Like the hairball formula my cat loves these treats. As an older cat she experiences no health problems and I attribute that to to a healthy diet.	2
Yup. I did call it that. She loves it. She loves all of the wet food so far. She's a happy healthy doggy. Thank you!	2
This toy is really fun because it bounces all around so he plays with it and then tries to get the treats out.	2
I'm very happy with this purchase... it's very easy to install, and does a great job of protecting my leather seats.  Nicely covers all areas that a pet might come into contact with (other than the door panels).Seems well made, and I suspect it will last for years.Highly recommended!	2
I love this shampoo for my dogs. I have three Maltipoos and 2 Mini Schnauzers. It lathers up nice and thick and a little goes a long way. I love the little conditioner beads that burst as you are lathering up. Smells great too and the scent last several days too.	2
I have used this product for my elderly dogs for years it really helps them and without the side effects of NSAIDS or steroids. I would recommend people try this before giving drugs for their dogs with arthritis	2
I have black backgrounds in my aquariums, and these work out great.  They do not show up at all!  Highly recommend.	2
These are huge pads..fantastic for traveling --- and there were so many !:) The price was perfect. I couldn't believe how 'cheap' they were, but the quality super!	2
What a GREAT. Toy for big or small dogs.Ollie my brothers dog. LOVED THIS TOY  in fact I plan to buy another. SoonVery long. Soft.	2
I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with a very sensitive stomach. When I use this product, he seems to be much more comfortable, and his elimination is more normal.	2
Crisps are the way to go instead of those tiny mushed up flakes you buy at WalMart... Crisps hold their shape and there's no waste with no clouding of your water... just the right size for all of my fish - and I have some that are palm sized.	2
These polishing pads are slightly thicker than the original ones I replaced but work great! My water stays clearer than ever! The 6-pack is great so I don't have to reorder so often!	2
Soft and comfy as it should be an the dog is thrilled.  She's always on it.  Very nice bed.  Haven't washed it yet or anything, but we love this so far.	2
Kongs are the best! I use the XXL size for my English Mastiff girl who currently weighs in at 120 lbs and is 13 months old. It keeps her working for  her treats and tires out the mind at the same time.	2
I now have 5 cats (2 new kittens just came home) and I bought this liter box hoping to make the liter changing job easier. It's fantastic! So simple it makes me wonder, "why didn't someone think of this before?" Great product, now I will order a second for the rest of the cats.	2
I've ordered three of these and all three work like a charm.  They keep the temperature right at whatever you set it to. Unless its very warm in your home it will not overheat.	2
I ordered 2 of these for my 350 penguin hob filter, they work great, much easier and cheaper to refill these cartridges with media than going out and buying new cartridges every two to three weeks, great item to have.	2
They do what they show.  Unbelievably handy for picking up little worms and dubia roaches for my lizard	2
Well the cats are very temperamental and some timesif dont like the vitamins are no way to change they minds butthis product really like , they eat and look for more is very easy to givecome on time	2
My girls love and for the pooch on a grain-free diet they keep the girls attention perfectly.  They come in formed filets that are scored to easily break into tiny pieces for use during training.	2
My cat is a hefty 14 lbs.  She jumped on this, as soon as it arrived.  She considers it her special spot.  For napping and for grooming.	2
Some times on the road you need a way to keep your pet controlled.and i've found that this is a good means for me any way of doing that. It works for me. Sure it will work for you!!  THanks  Pitbullman	2
It did get tired after five years, but I went and bought another.  My cat uses it daily -- for drinking not for washing.	2
I really like this little pan.  i purchased it for use in the three tier condo.  It is very sturdy and well made.  I am glad I found it.	2
I will say that I do have some finicky cats (4 total... 2 are normal, 1 is a diabetic obese SCAREDY CAT, and 1 special needs) They are learning that it is safe and not so scary to use it. What a time saver -- it's SO clean, no more smells, so easy to use. LOVE... and easy to install	2
My local stores run out of these a lot and sometimes I can't find one when I need it.  They also tend to cost a lot more than they do here.  If you have a Prime membership save yourself some money and buy them from Amazon!	2
They are great to use as a snack for your dog and for training. Small and light like Goldfish crackers with very little to no odor to them. Ace likes them and will catch it with his mouth when I toss them in the air.	2
My dog loves it.	2
All I know is that our 13 year old Lahsa Apso happily chews up his arithritic pill in the pill pocket each morning.	2
i foster basset hounds and have found that this stuff, coupled with salmon oil, solved a lot of itchy and allergy problems. grows hair back beautifully on unhealthy dogs.	2
Totally washable and stays in place because of the Elastic bands. Always good to have several as you will want to wash them periodically.	2
Simple to use, and accurate results.  The color card used to read the results is clear and accurate. (My last card, I could never figure out the results - turned out it was printed without all the colors!)	2
Apparently mine does. She loves the toothpaste so much that she thinks she's getting a treat. Makes brushing teeth much easier	2
If you have a dog with chronic skin problems then I suggest this shampoo. Our Mastiff has such skin problems but this shampoo gives him relief and also helps heal.	2
My dog likes to sniff the pads.I would highly recommend this product.I think these are the best ones on the market.	2
A great all round quality product. My tetras, discus,loaches love it. My guppies love it. Just grind it up in your fingers when feeding. Also great to feed new born. As with the guppies grind it up to a fine powder. I always use Tetra brand.	2
