What happened to the original silver colored Pike Place Roast coffee?  My recent orders in my account has been replaced by Medium Pike Place Roast which I never ordered?  And all the reviews prior to this review of mine belonged to that original Pike Place Roast, not the medium one...This is not right.	1
I usually love Chips Ahoy products, but not these. The chocolate had a very funky aftertaste. I have to wonder if they were somehow affected by shipment, but I probably wouldn't chance buying them at the store. I usually don't have a problem with any type of cookie, but I gave these to my dad.	1
Not whole nuts but broken pieces, brownish and not white, stale, old and bitter.  Unable to eat them. The worst I ever had.	1
I thought that I should try a single pack from my local co op before buying multiples. So glad I only bought one pack. These smell horrible, like chemicals. The texture is mushy and not pleasing at all. I would never recommend these to anyone. I am going to try kelp noodles as a replacement for these.	1
I've been eating these for months and actually really enjoy them.  I just came online in order to buy some more and decided to read these one-star reviews (I couldn't believe somebody didn't like them!) -- I have eaten my very last Trio bar.  And (sarcastically) thank you very much Mrs. May!!!!	1
Kinda makes me feel like I'm eating chocolate throw-up pounded into a bar. Not tasty at all. Wish I could return.	1
This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.	1
Horrid dented cans. Do fall for this scam of dented cans.this was replacement order and cans dented rip off dont be fooled	1
All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior.	1
this product has a terrible.  the taste is awful. You only get a hint of the flavor peach.  i like it has zero sugars ,fat carbs, but does it have to taste so bad.	1
I do not recommend the Grove brand of coffee and certainly not the Cappuccino. One cannot brew even a decent Cappuccino in a Kcup brewer. It takes a real Cappuccino brewer with high pressure and steamed milk. This Capuccino lover says forget this one.	1
I should have read the nutritional information--way more sodium than my husband should have at a meal.  The packaging is bulky and it takes a long time to soften.  The small salad is supposed to serve 2.  On the plus side it does taste good.	1
Eating this stuff. The grains are hard as pebbles. The whole family here voted "Horrible". We will use for bird feed.	1
If these taste like cinnamon bars, I'm a monkey's uncle. My mother and I spit them out.Don't waste your money.	1
Absolutely no coffe taste at all.Just do make out that its chocolate.Sorry Product.There are more choices on Amazon that are much better.	1
I switched to whole milk. I tried Pure and Nido to use in my office to add to coffee and tea. Pure fits my needs, since it dissolves well in hot beverages. Nido tastes very well as well, but does not dissolve very well in hot beverages.	1
This peanut butter tastes horrible just like the choco choco chunk.  I couldn't give it away either.  No body liked it.  It went in the garbage and got refunded.	1
This would have been a nice mix if not for the guar gum. If you have anyone in the family with IBS, this will likely cause stomach cramps for a day or so - not pleasant.	1
Too hot and maybe one part of a shrimp in the entire bowl.  If it had not have been so hot the noodles would have been good.  I had to drink milk with it to cool my mouth down,	1
I love Annie's regular mac & cheese, but this version was gross.  The white mystery powder turned into a gross, gelatinous mess when I heated the product as directed with water.  The whole thing just turned my stomach and I thew it out	1
Tastes like soap.  Impossible to regulate the amount of caffeine you're ingesting - you're supposed to use a squirt, but depending on how long you squeeze, lots of the liquid can go into your drink.	1
Not sure what they were going for, a taste of Aloe or just crisp fresh water, but anyway they missed on both ends. This thing tastes horrible. I even tried giving it to my kids to try and they thought it was horrible as well. It was pulp free but just didn't taste like aloe.	1
I have had several other brands of kettle chips before, all of which are delicious and rather addicting. These chips, however, did not live up to expectations - they tasted like lightly flavored cardboard! I didn't even finish the bag, and ended up throwing it out. If you're looking for flavorful kettle chips, look elsewhere.	1
So i tried this one day and was naseuous after drinking one serving mixed with water.Maybe it was funky artificial mango pineapple taste? Or the artificial sweeteners in it? Either way it was pretty nasty.. I wouldnt drink this again nor offer to anyone.	1
I really didn't like this drink at all. There is a bitter after taste that I couldn't get out of my mouth for a long time. I tried drinking it slowly, sipping, then drinking quickly, nothing helped. I finally gave them to my husband and he drinks it some but still we have a lot left over.	1
One can never have enough vanilla extract. This isn't gourmet or anything, but it gets the job done and lasts forever.	2
I have gotten Bob's Red Mill products for many years and this fits in with the expectations I have from them. Good product.	2
is a favorite for me and now my kids it was a very good deal for the money and you can buy the 24 hours a day at home in your pjs	2
You cannot go wrong with this purchase.  The dried fruit is large and has great flavor.  I will buy again and again.	2
These seem to be a specialty item and aren't available in the bigger bags, but that's OK. I like them anyway. Nice jalapeno zing to them--very tasty.	2
We've used these for apples, in a few recipes, and just for a candy dessert.  They work well, taste great, and won't disappoint you.  We recommend them.	2
You've been warned.  These are really good.  Don't open a bag and sit down with it.  Just sayin'.  I love putting these in my lunch.  Annie's is a name our family trusts, and we like all their products, but this one is especially delicious.	2
The water had a good clean taste.  I like the idea that it is PH balanced.  I had my husband try it too and he said it was good water.  No aftertaste or anything.	2
Easy to mix, tastes great! Non-Celiac husband loves these!For those that need ingredient lists, go to the actual Betty Crocker site before submitting negative reviews...sheesh.	2
This is the best cinnamon I have ever used.  The flavor is really intense, and it has somewhat of a bite to it.  I ordered some for my daughter who is a chef, and now she'll use no other cinnamon.	2
I must use decaf, but have been so disappointed with many decaf coffees that just don't have enough flavor, or are bitter and strong.  This is a bold and tasy blend...will definitely reorder.	2
It's wonderful to be able to have GF instant oatmeal for breakfast now, which is something that I haven't been about to have for at least 10 years.	2
I love love love these candies. Great way to get little ones exposed to ginger sweet with a bite spicy at the end.	2
This was a lot cheaper ordering on line than going to the Whole food Stores.akes a great selser soda pop.	2
I make instant tea in a large mug, and was opening packet upon packet of splenda to sweeten it. EZ-Sweetz tastes just the same, and a few drops are much easier than opening all those packets. I think it comes out to be about the same price also.	2
Loved this product.  Great snack to travel with and to take to work.  No mess - no fuss - great for all ages	2
Of the flavored coffees I have tried Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is by far my favorite.  It has a wonderful flavor and being able to buy in a larger quanity is a definite plus.	2
I keep these around for a quick breakfast when I'm in a hurry. They look weird, but they are really tasty ans surprisingly filling.	2
You already know these are perfect!!	2
I sent this to my parents on the east coast. They have a strict diet so I needed something for both of them.  It arrived quickly and they told me how much they loved it. It was yummy and pretty and a good price. I am pleased with this and would recommend it.	2
Great coffee great price nice flavor great value will buy again works well in kerig machines no leakage no grounds in coffee	2
I look forward to my one cup a day.  I will keep on ordering this coffee.  I highly recommend it to everyone.	2
3 granddaughters and their mom almost came to blows over who got to pick first.  the youngest (kind of a bulldozer in a tiny blond sparkle dressed body) won the battle hands down.  thankfully there was enough to go around in this large bag.	2
I love sesame seeds.  I have to make my own GF bread, buns and meals.  I love to use the sesame seeds in many of my asian dishes.  The seeds make the bread taste great too.  My 5 year loves it so it must be good.	2
This ghee is smooth, nutty, and delicious. I would highly recommend it as a cooking oil. Our Indian dishes taste much more authentic when we use ghee vs butter.	2
put this o my motorcycle and wanted this one due to its small size.  Works as good as the full sized ones, better than Homelink  and remarkable range.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a great cat food. All 3 of my pure bred cats love it and it is the recommended food for my hedgehog as well. He chows a lot of it down considering his size!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Yes, you can see in the dark, Virginia. Aim the light down to see the ground, up to annoy fellow campers while you're talking to them. Lots of useful fun.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Great little light - bright, easy to install, great quality. Makes it easier to see my fusebox, etc. Would work anywhere...	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
My husband used this to open up an Xbox controller to clean it because it was not working well.  Worked fine on taking the controller apart and putting it back together again.  He said he would have liked it if the handle would have been a little longer for more tork.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This was a  perfect fit for my Petzl headlight.  I wasn't looking for anything too fancy, just a way to pack this light for storage or for travel.  no complaints.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I have four cats and none of them ate this food. I ended up letting the racoons eat it at night.  All cats are different where there eating habits are concerned. But none of mine would touch it. They smelled it and walked away. It sat on the floor a week before I gave it all to the racoons.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Having the right length screw, and one that will last (stand up to weather, etc.) makes the job worth doing.  A little pricey, but not bad.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
with two dogs in a small space I love these pads.  They are finally big enough and strong enough to contain everything, easy to dispose of and the company delivers promptly.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are something quick not long-term chews.  The dogs can eat them in about five minutes or less BUT they are loved by all.  Great product.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
The dogs love them but I do not like the smell of them myself. It smells strange but my opinion does not matter	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is the only cat toy that May cats will play with until they can't move anymore. Even cats who don't like to play, play with this. Love it, low human effort!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
These are working well so far in my lamp outside. They seem to be brighter than the old lights, I just hope they last as long as they claim!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
Assembled in seconds.  Large and sturdy design.Only problem, my 22 lb tabby kept hurling himself against the sides to move it around the backyard.  My little calico screamed her head off and wanted back in the house... so...Off to a friend who has two cats who absolutely love it!	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
When I first got it in, I thought how cheap it looked and that when I turn the water on I was going to have a leak, but to my surprise it didn't leak. The valve quickly turns the water on and off. I was impressed. Thanks for a fine product.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This works like it says it does. I immediately gave my 2 cats relief. No more fleas for them. One of the was scratching at his neck so hard that he had a sore. It's scabbing over now. They're happy, I'm happy.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I had a bit tip break off on a job, which was frustrating. So, I decided to buy two new bits and keep one as a back-up bit. So far, the first bit is still sharp and still performing well.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I started my allergy dogs on this... then all of them went on it. I have seen an improvement with all my dogs on the solid gold seameal.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
I ordered 2 of these for my 350 penguin hob filter, they work great, much easier and cheaper to refill these cartridges with media than going out and buying new cartridges every two to three weeks, great item to have.	UNCONFIDENT_INTENT_FROM_SLAD
This is a very well built and solid sander.The sander is very heavy and there is very little vibration(if any) so the sander will stay put and not move so there is no need to mount it to a stand or table,it will stay put where ever it is placed.It is well worth the cost and I strongly recommend it!
